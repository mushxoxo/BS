As per a report by 9To5Google, the updates include AI-powered article summaries and an easier way to bookmark stories. The AI summaries will likely provide a snapshot of the news by combining information from multiple sources, while the save button may offer a quicker way to manage reading lists — all without leaving the feed. AI Summary feature in Discover feed As per the report, the new Discover cards display a cluster of small, overlapping icons, each representing a source used to generate the AI summary. Tapping on the icon group opens a “More” page listing all articles used in the summary. Each card features a brief three-line summary with a “See more” button below. A disclaimer at the bottom notes that the content is “Generated with AI, which can make mistakes,” similar to Google's AI Overviews in Search.

The source name has been minimized in size, shifting attention to the AI-generated summary to help users quickly grasp the essence of the story. For users, this could mean faster access to key story details without needing to open each link. However, it may also impact traffic to original news sites, as users might skip visiting full articles if they feel sufficiently informed by the summaries.

This integration brings Canva’s design tools directly into Claude’s chat interface, eliminating the need to switch between apps. Alongside Canva, Claude is also gaining new connectors for popular services like Notion and Stripe, as well as desktop apps such as Figma, Socket, and Prisma. These connectors allow Claude to interact with both web-based and local tools, enabling it to perform tasks, fetch data, and respond with greater contextual awareness. Canva integration within Claude AI Users with paid subscriptions to both Claude and Canva can now ask Claude to create presentations, resize images, or fill out templates just by using text prompts. Claude can also search for keywords within Canva Docs, Presentations, and brand templates, and can even summarise design content. In a statement to The Verge, Anwar Haneef, head of Canva’s Ecosystem, said users can now “generate, summarise, review, and publish Canva designs directly in a Claude chat,” removing the need to manually upload or transfer content. He noted that this was made possible by Model Context Protocol (MCP), which enables such interactions through a simple toggle in settings — ushering in more user-friendly, AI-first workflows. Claude is the first AI assistant to support Canva design workflows via MCP. This follows its earlier integration with Figma, announced last month. To make it easier for users to discover connected tools, Claude is also launching a new integrations directory on both web and desktop, offering a clear view of all available apps and services that can be used within the chatbot. What is MCP? MCP is an open-source standard developed by Anthropic that allows AI models to securely access and work with third-party tools.

The match was a tight contest from the get-go, with India dominating for most parts except the last few sessions, where the home side edged past the visitors to secure the win and go 2-1 up in the series. India came into the Test high on confidence after their 336-run victory at Edgbaston and were hoping for another win at Lord’s. But they lost battles at crucial junctures of the game, which cost them the match and the chance to take the lead in the series. But what exactly went wrong for Shubman Gill and Co in the match? Let’s take a look. Lack of partnerships during the chase Probably one of the biggest reasons for India’s loss is the lack of big partnerships while chasing a small target of 193 in the fourth innings. India’s biggest partnership of the innings was 36 runs between KL Rahul and Karun Nair for the second wicket. After that, the partnerships for the subsequent five wickets were 1, 5, 13, 10, and 1. India did get partnerships of 30, 35, and 23 for the last three wickets, but it was mostly Jadeja scoring runs, and he eventually ran out of partners as India fell 22 runs short of the target. Indian skipper Shubman Gill himself admitted after the match that all India needed to win was one big partnership. Gill, in the post-match presentation, said, “I was pretty confident of our chances with plenty of batting left. We needed a couple of 50-run partnerships but we weren’t able to get that.” Sluggish fielding takes toll again India’s sluggish fielding during the third Test was also one of the reasons why they lost the game. India dropped a total of four catches in England’s first innings. They dropped chances of Ollie Pope, who went on to score 44, Jamie Smith, who made 51, and Brydon Carse, who scored 56 before finally being dismissed. All of these missed opportunities cost India more than 75 runs, and had those chances been converted, the final story of the match could have been different. Rahul lone ranger at the top order The biggest reason for India’s success at Edgbaston was their top order going full throttle—something that was missing in the third Test. Except KL Rahul, who scored 100 and 39 in the two innings, no other top-order batter was able to deliver for India. Yashasvi Jaiswal scored 13 and 0 in the two innings, falling to Jofra Archer on both occasions. Karun Nair scored 40 in the first innings but failed again in the second innings, being dismissed for just 14. One of the biggest setbacks for India was Shubman Gill’s outing with the bat. The Indian skipper had 585 runs to his name in the four innings before the start of the match, but at Lord’s, he could only score 16 and 6. Across two innings, the total score from India’s top order—except Rahul—was only 89 runs, which heavily hurt India’s chances in the match. Skipper Stokes stands tall for England One of the biggest reasons behind India’s loss was the English skipper Ben Stokes having the outing of his life. Stokes first scored 44 runs with the bat in the first innings before taking two wickets with the ball. But his biggest contribution during the first innings came when he ran Rishabh Pant out on 74, completely changing the momentum of the match. Stokes continued his exploits in the second innings and again scored a crucial 33 runs with the bat before taking three wickets to lead England to an exciting victory. Bowlers’ trouble to dismiss tail-enders continues One of the biggest problems for Indian bowlers for a long time has been that even when they manage to dismiss the top and middle order early, they often fail to finish off the tail-enders quickly and end up conceding critical runs. The same was the case during England’s first innings, where India reduced the home side to 271 for 7 but conceded another 116 runs for the final three wickets. While Jamie Smith (51) was a recognised batter at the crease at the time, Brydon Carse (56) was England’s No. 8 batter. Carse not only scored a half-century but also added 32 runs for the last two wickets with Archer and Bashir to help England finish the innings at a strong total of 387.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "1:12 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T13:12:00", "topics": ["India cricket team", "England cricket team", "ICC World Test Championship", "Test Cricket", "India vs England"], "author": "Aditya Kaushik", "premium": "False"}

The bulletin, released late last week, outlines crucial Final Action Dates and Dates for Filing, which determine when immigrants can move forward with their green card applications. India EB-3 Moves Forward, EB-2 Flatlines Indian applicants under the EB-3 category — which includes skilled workers, professionals, and other workers — saw their Final Action Date advance by one month, from April 2025 to May 22, 2013. While the progress is marginal, it marks the only forward movement for Indian employment-based applicants this month. In contrast, EB-2 applicants — typically professionals with advanced degrees — saw no movement, with the Final Action Date for India remaining at January 1, 2013. This is concerning, as the category remains highly backlogged for Indian nationals. “Visa demand and number use remain high in the EB-2 and EB-3 categories, and issuance totals are rapidly approaching the annual limits for FY2025,” the Department of State noted in the bulletin. Retrogression Watch for Other Countries The bulletin also revealed that for non-India and non-China applicants, the EB-2 Final Action Date has retrogressed by 1.5 months to September 1, 2023, a response to the surging demand that threatens to exceed the annual visa cap. The Department has warned that if the usage threshold is hit, EB-2 visas could become “unavailable” before the fiscal year ends on September 30. EB-5 Sees Big Gains, Especially for India The EB-5 visa category — often dubbed the \"investor green card\" — brings more encouraging news for Indian applicants. The Final Action Date for India’s unreserved EB-5 visas has moved forward by over six months, while China saw an even more dramatic two-year advancement. This progress is significant given the increasing interest among Indian high-net-worth individuals in the EB-5 route, especially in the wake of long EB-2/EB-3 queues and the growing backlog of employment-based visas. EB-1 and Other Categories: No Change for India There was no movement in the EB-1 category (for extraordinary ability or multinational executives) for India or China, with Final Action Dates for India holding at February 15, 2022. Similarly, China EB-2 (Dec 15, 2020) and China EB-1 (Nov 15, 2022) also remained unchanged. What This Means for Applicants Indian skilled workers in EB-3 may now file if their priority date is before May 22, 2013 EB-2 India remains stalled, with no signs of movement amid high demand EB-5 India applicants can expect faster processing if their investments are aligned with the unreserved category USCIS will use Final Action Dates in the August 2025 bulletin to determine filing eligibility Visa Limits: A Ticking Clock For FY2025, the employment-based preference limit is 140,000, with per-country caps of 7% (25,620 visas). With demand surging and annual limits nearing exhaustion, the Department of State has cautioned that several categories may be closed for further processing as early as September. Key Takeaways for Indian Applicants: File as soon as eligible — demand is approaching statutory caps Expect continued delays in EB-2, but monitor EB-3 and EB-5 movement closely Watch for September retrogressions, especially if priority dates are borderline As the US immigration system continues to strain under backlog pressure, employment-based applicants from India may need to prepare for a longer wait — or consider alternative visa strategies, including the EB-5 or O-1 categories.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "12:55 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T12:55:00", "topics": ["US visa"], "author": "BS Web Team", "premium": "False"}

A bench of Justices MM Sundresh and N Kotiswar Singh will be hearing the replies next Tuesday. This comes after the counsel appearing for the states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand sought a minimum of two weeks to reply. However, counsel appearing for the petitioner sought urgency, adding that the matter is \"time-sensitive\" as the Kanwar Yatra will get over in 10-12 days. According to the petitioners, the directives issued by the two governments would enable the pilgrims to access the details of the owners. The plea has sought a stay on all directives that require or enable the public disclosure of the ownership/employee identity of food vendors along the Kanwar Yatra routes in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The petitioners, in their plea, argue that these directives issued by the state governments conflict with an interim order that the Supreme Court issued last year, which held that food sellers cannot be forced to reveal their identities. They further argued that to bypass the Supreme Court's interim order, the state governments have issued directives this year, mandating the display of QR codes on all eateries along the Kanwar Yatra route. The applicants further claim that the intent is to cause religious profiling of the sellers along the routes. The report added that even though the eatery owners are required to obtain licences and display them, they need to be displayed inside the premises only.

Speaking at a media briefing following the announcement of the ‘Youth Spiritual Summit’, an anti-drug initiative launching on July 18 in Varanasi, the minister shed light on key developments in Indian sports governance. Mandaviya emphasized the government's intent to move forward with reformative legislation aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability in sports administration. “The bill will be presented in Parliament this session. I’ll be sharing further details in the next few days,” he stated. What the Bill Proposes The National Sports Governance Bill aims to bring significant reforms to how sports bodies in India are run. Central to the bill is the establishment of a regulatory board tasked with recognizing National Sports Federations (NSFs) and allocating funding based on their adherence to principles of good governance. The regulatory authority will also ensure that all NSFs comply with ethical, financial, and governance standards. In line with this, the draft also calls for the creation of Ethics Commissions and Dispute Resolution Commissions to promote transparency and resolve conflicts efficiently. Pakistan athletes welcome for upcoming events Addressing international participation, Minister Mandaviya clarified India’s position regarding Pakistani athletes competing in multi-nation tournaments hosted in India. “We have assured Pakistan that their athletes will be granted visas for upcoming events like the Asia Cup and the Junior Hockey World Cup. It is now up to their government to decide on participation. From our side, there are no restrictions,” he confirmed. He added that India remains committed to ensuring equal treatment for all nations taking part in international competitions on its soil. These developments underline the government’s push toward a more structured and transparent sports ecosystem while maintaining an open-door policy for international sporting collaboration.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "12:46 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T12:46:00", "topics": ["Sports News"], "author": "Shashwat Nishant", "premium": "False"}

Investor sentiment turned bullish as the retail inflation figure dropped to a 6-year low, raising bets of a status quo on repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) At 11:45 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 82,673.58, up by more than 400 points or 0.51 per cent. The index hit an intraday high of 82,744, up 490 points. The Nifty50, meanwhile, was trading above 25,200 level, up by 137 points or 0.55 per cent. It hit an intraday high of 25,245. Nearly all stocks from the Sensex pack were trading in green. Sun Pharma, Mahindra and Mahindra, Infosys, Tata Motors and Bharti Airtel were among the top gainers. On the other hand, HCL Tech, Eternal (Zomato), Tata Steel. UltraTech Cement and Axis Bank were among the top losers. CATCH STOCK MARKET LIVE UPDATES TODAY The bullish sentiment was more noticeable in the broader markets. The Nifty Midcap 100 was trading at 59,445, up by 0.69 per cent. Whereas, the Nifty Smallcap 100 rose by 0.76 per cent, quoting 19,099. All the sectoral indices were trading in the green territory. The Nifty Auto index was on the top, up by 1.55 per cent, quoting 23,917. The Nifty PSU Bank index followed suit and surged over 1.06 per cent, trading at 7,151. While earnings for the first quarter of the financial year 2025-26 (Q1FY26) will continue to provide directional momentum to markets ahead, here is why Sensex, Nifty are rising today: CPI at 6-year low The June CPI inflation figure dropped to a 6-year low level of 2.10 per cent. The steep decline in the figure was mainly owing to two reasons: favourable base effect and food inflation taking a breather. This, analysts said, might raise expectations of a further rate cut after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) slashed rates by 50 basis points (bps) in a surprise move during the last monetary policy committee (MPC) meet. \"A significant macro trend is the decline of CPI inflation in June to 2.10 per cent. It appears that inflation will undershoot RBI's projection of 3.7 per cent CPI inflation for FY26. This has raised rate cut hopes. But now the question is whether another 25 bps rate cut stimulate credit growth which is languishing at around 9 per cent,\" said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. Strong buying in SMIDs While the benchmark indices witnessed a robust buying spree on Tuesday, smallcap and midcap stocks experienced a sharper uptrend. For instance, the BSE Smallcap index reached a 6-month high on Tuesday, gaining over 30 per cent from the year-to-date (YTD) low levels. The strong investor interest in the smallcap and midcap segment was also visible in net inflows recorded in June month. Equity mutual funds witnessed a strong resurgence in June, with net inflows rising sharply to ₹23,568 crore from ₹18,994.56 crore in May. According to Dikshit Mittal, senior fund manager-equity at LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management, this momentum was largely driven by strong inflows into the midcap and smallcap segments, signalling growing investor confidence in India’s long-term growth prospects, even amidst global headwinds. US-India trade deal Anticipations around a prospective trade deal between the US and India ahead of the August 1 deadline are also gaining momentum. As per reports, the interim trade deal can bring down the proposed tariff rate below 20 per cent. \"The US is working toward an interim trade deal with India that may reduce its proposed tariffs to below 20 per cent,\" a report by Bloomberg said.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "12:41 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T12:41:00", "topics": ["Stock Market", "S&P BSE Sensex", "Markets Sensex Nifty", "Midcap smallcap", "Markets", "MARKETS TODAY"], "author": "Harshita Dudeja", "premium": "False"}

In the first five months of 2025, 45,591 residential plots have been launched, which is 36% of the supply in CY 2024 and 28% of the supply in CY 2023. \"The estimated launch value of the residential plots in 10 tier I-II cities between 2022 and 2025 (May) is approximately Rs 2.44 lakh crore.

For developers, plots generate quick cash flow as they involve faster sales and less upfront investment as compared to apartments,\" said Samir Jasuja, Founder and CEO, PropEquity. “The demand for plots was quite pronounced in tier II cities and top southern cities, namely Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai. As demand for apartments/floors/villas has shown some signs of weakness in the first half of 2025, the shift of investment towards plots is very likely going forward. Bengaluru in tier I, and tier II cities like Indore, Raipur, Coimbatore and Mysore have seen robust price escalation in 2024.” However, the report further highlighted that the supply of residential plots in the top 10 tier I & II cities fell 23% Y-o-Y in 2024 to 1,26,556 plots after recording 24% Y-o-Y growth in 2023 to 1,63,529 plots. Three cities saw a rise in supply in 2024, namely Chennai (27%), Coimbatore (40%) and Surat (2%). The other seven cities saw a fall in supply. In volume terms, Indore topped the list with 26,538 residential plots launched in 2024, followed by Chennai and Hyderabad. The weighted average launch price of residential plots in the top 10 tier I and tier II cities rose 27% YoY in 2024 to Rs 3679 per sq. ft. which translates to Rs 33,111 per sq. yard and Rs 39,586 per sq. mt. Where Is the Supply Coming From? While Tier II cities dominate in volume, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Chennai are the only Tier I cities in the top 10, collectively contributing 2.25 lakh units or 48% of total plotted supply. The top 10 cities with the highest residential plot launches between 2022 and May 2025 are: Hyderabad Indore Bengaluru Chennai Nagpur Jaipur Coimbatore Mysore Raipur Surat Tier II Cities Are the Real Growth Story From Indore and Coimbatore to Raipur and Mysore, Tier II markets have become the focal point for plotted development.

The Centre had contended that the hearing on the review petitions cannot go beyond the two specific issues flagged by the bench which issued notice on the petitions in August 2022. Sibal had earlier submitted that the matter was required to be referred to a larger bench. Mehta had contended that the bench, which considered the review petitions for admission in August 2022, issued notice only on two aspects - the supply of the ECIR copy to the accused and reversal of burden of proof under Section 24 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The apex court in July 2022 upheld the ED powers of arrest and attachment of property involved in money laundering, search and seizure under PMLA. In August the same year, the top court agreed to hear pleas seeking review of its verdict and observed that two aspects \"prima facie\" required reconsideration. Observing money laundering was a \"threat\" to the good functioning of a financial system world over, the apex court upheld the validity of certain provisions of the PMLA, underlining it was not an \"ordinary offence\". The top court said authorities under the 2002 law were \"not police officers as such\" and the ECIR could not be equated with an FIR under the Code of Criminal Procedure. The supply of an ECIR copy in every case to the person concerned was not mandatory and it was enough if the ED, at the time of arrest, disclosed the grounds for it, it added. The 2022 verdict had come on a batch of over 200 petitions questioning various provisions of the PMLA, a law the opposition often claims is weaponised by the government to harass its political adversaries. Section 45 of the PMLA, which deals with offences to be cognisable and non-bailable and have twin conditions for bail, is reasonable and does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness, the top court said.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "12:35 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T12:35:00", "topics": ["Supreme Court", "Enforcement Directorate", "PMLA"], "author": "Press Trust of India", "premium": "False"}

The design language of the OnePlus Buds 4 is akin to OnePlus Nord Buds 3. Priced at Rs 5,999, the OnePlus Buds 4 offers active noise cancellation (ANC), clear audio output, and support for multi-point connectivity. But are these true wireless stereo (TWS) earbuds actually a feature-packed proposition in the budget segment? Let’s find out: Design The OnePlus Buds 4 shares a striking resemblance to OnePlus Nord Buds 3. If I have to put it in simple words, then the design has essentially been copied and pasted without any innovation, at least look-wise. Be it the buds or the case, everything in terms of design remains the same. The OnePlus Buds 4 boasts an IP55 rating for resistance against dust and water. These wireless earbuds sport a classic design while being lightweight and comfortable for prolonged usage. The OnePlus Buds 4 comes with multiple tip sizes to ensure a snug fit for users, which will aid in noise isolation functionality. Fair warning, though, the earbuds are a bit slippery, so if you aren’t careful while handling them, you might end up dropping them. Coming to the casing, the OnePlus Buds 4 comes in a single-tone finish pebble-shaped case with the OnePlus logo and a battery indicator placed right in front of it. It sports a matte finish, which makes it resistant to smudges and fingerprint marks. The bottom of the case features a USB-C type port for charging, and the right side features a button to make pairing with your device easier. Features The OnePlus Buds 4 features three modes – Noise cancellation, Adaptive, and Transparency. OnePlus boasts up to 55dB noise cancellation in the Buds 4. In real life, the Chinese consumer electronics maker did deliver on its promise. I used these earbuds in my office, which is usually filled with chatter and laughter, and the OnePlus Buds 4 was able to block the majority of noise. I also used it in the Delhi Metro, and if any of you have travelled in the Delhi Metro, especially during the peak hours of 6 pm on the blue or yellow line, then you have a fair idea of how noisy it is. Even inside the metro, with children crying at the top of their lungs and some stranger talking loudly on his phone, the OnePlus Buds 4 was able to block 90 to 95 per cent of the noise. I was barely able to hear any disturbance in my music-listening experience while travelling. The transparency mode in the OnePlus Buds 4 offers you a real-life environment. When turned on, you will be able to listen to your music while also having a fair idea of what’s happening around you. In simple words, it means that you will be able to hear music while also hearing the kid behind you crying as if his world is ending. The adaptive mode strikes a balance between ANC and transparency mode. The OnePlus Buds 4 turn on the ANC or the transparency mode depending on the environment you are in at that particular time. Additionally, it comes with OnePlus 3D Audio mode, which delivers 3D spatial audio. It performs decently, but nothing extraordinary. It also packs a game mode that reduces latency in audio output, making gaming feel more synced and connected. The OnePlus Buds 4 come with in-ear detection technology, meaning the moment you pull them out of your ears, it will stop the music. The earbuds offer dual connection, making it easy for you to pair them with two different devices and switch between them. These TWS feature steady connect technology, which aims to maintain a stable connection, even in outdoor settings. Also, one can swipe on earbuds to control the audio level, eliminating the need to use the buttons on phones or any other connected devices. Furthermore, the OnePlus Buds 4 comes with AI translation technology. The OnePlus Buds 4 supports face-to-face translation and live translation. The former is essentially for situations when you are sitting in a meeting with someone who speaks a different language from you. You will turn on the feature, and the microphones in the Buds 4 will pick up what the person is saying, translate it into your language, and play it in your ear within a time span of one to two seconds. The latter is essentially for situations where both parties need to communicate. With this feature, the screen gets split into two halves, and the mic icon will be available on both sides, so each party can click on it, in turn, to carry out the conversation easily. The features are no doubt really great and useful, however, in terms of translations, I found that AI was not able to translate everything accurately. To sum it up, it is good and works fine, but it isn’t 100 per cent reliable. Audio and Calls These earbuds deliver a sound profile with clear mids and heavy bass, making them suitable for various genres of music and media. They don’t compromise on clarity for loudness, which I really liked. Coming to my experience during calls, I would say that the OnePlus Buds 4 did get the basics right, but it didn’t excel. It was able to handle normal calls well, especially when I was sitting in a quiet environment. The clarity of my audio and the people that I was talking to were both good. But the moment I stepped out in noisy environments, the OnePlus Buds 4 failed to deliver a crystal clear sound output to the people I was talking to. Their voice was perfectly fine, but when I asked about the quality and clarity of my voice, I did get to hear that the background noise was still creeping in despite the earbuds’ noise reduction. Companion app Non-OnePlus users can access the core features of the OnePlus Buds 4 through the “Hey Melody” companion app, available on both Android and iOS. It allows control over noise cancellation, transparency mode, Sound Master EQ, Game mode, and Find My Earbuds. For those using a OnePlus phone, all these settings are integrated directly into the Bluetooth menu, so no separate app is required. Battery In terms of battery, the OnePlus Buds 4 performed well. On a single charge, I got around three to six hours of battery backup (depending on the mode I was using it in). If I used it purely on ANC, then it would last me somewhere around three hours. If I switched off all modes, then I got around six hours of battery backup, and when I used adaptive or transparency, I got around four to five hours of battery backup on a single charge. With the case, the earbuds last for around 30 to 40 hours, which is decent. If I talk about the “quick charge,” meaning charging the earbuds for just 10 minutes, then it can easily last for up to 40 minutes. Talking about the full charge, the case will take around 45 minutes to get fully charged. Verdict The OnePlus Buds 4 packs premium features into an affordable package. With solid ANC, decent sound quality, and reliable battery life, they tick most of the right boxes for everyday use. Where they fall slightly short is in call quality under noisy conditions, and some of the AI translation features still feel like a work in progress. Still, for users prioritising audio clarity, noise isolation, and seamless device switching, the OnePlus Buds 4 are a good choice. If call quality in outdoor environments is a high priority, you might want to explore other options in this segment.

A meeting between representatives of prominent scholar and Sufi leader Sheikh Habib Umar bin Hafiz, and the family of Talal Abdo Mahdi, the Yemeni national allegedly killed by nurse Nimisha Priya in 2017, is expected to be held at Dhamar on Tuesday, they said. The development follows after the 94-year-old Musliyar, who is officially known as Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad and holds the title of Grand Mufti of India, held talks with religious authorities in Yemen. The meeting with the family will take place on Tuesday at 10 am, Yemeni local time. Kanthapuram's office said a close relative of the deceased Talal -- who is also the Chief Justice of the Hodeidah State Court and a member of the Yemeni Shura Council --has arrived in Dhamar, Talal's hometown, to take part in today's talks, following the advice of Sheikh Habib Umar. \"The fact that he is a follower of Sheikh Habib Umar's Sufi order and the son of another prominent Sufi leader offers great hope. Along with persuading the family, he is also expected to meet the Attorney General to initiate urgent efforts to postpone the execution scheduled for tomorrow,\" it said. \"We see the agreement of the family to hold talks with representatives of the Sufi spiritual leader as a positive signal towards our efforts to halt the scheduled execution for the time being,\" a source said. Sources said Talal's murder is not just an emotional issue for the family, but also among the tribes and the residents of the Dhamar region. This is why no one had been able to establish contact with the family until now. \"It was only through Kanthapuram's intervention that communication with the family became possible for the first time,\" they said. The family agreed to the talks following the advice of Sheikh Habib Umar bin Hafiz. \"Today's discussion is focused on reaching a final decision regarding the acceptance of blood money. As efforts continue to convince the family, Kanthapuram has also requested the Yemeni authorities to temporarily defer the execution scheduled for July 16 --a request the Yemeni administration is expected to consider today,\" a source said. Nimisha Priya, a nurse from Palakkad district in Kerala, is facing execution on July 16 for the murder of Mahdi, her Yemeni business partner. She was sentenced to death in 2020, and her final appeal was rejected in 2023. She is currently imprisoned in a jail in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. The Centre on Monday had informed the Supreme Court that the government could do \"nothing much\" in the case. Attorney General R Venkataramani had informed a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta that the government was doing \"utmost possible\". \"The Government of India is trying its best,\" Venkataramani said, \"and has also engaged with some sheikhs who are very influential people there.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "12:26 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T12:26:00", "topics": ["Yemen", "nurse", "execution"], "author": "Press Trust of India", "premium": "False"}

Analysts expect the private bank to witness a low single-digit growth in net profit, on a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) basis, during the April-June quarter of the current financial year (Q1FY26) amid muted loan growth and higher slippages. They also project Axis Bank to see a contraction in margins due to a falling interest rate regime. Axis Bank Q1 results date, time: According to the bank’s stock exchange filing, the bank will hold a meeting of the Board of Directors on Thursday, July 17, to declare Q1FY26 results. \"A meeting of the Board of Directors of Axis Bank Limited will be held on Thursday, July 17, 2025, inter alia to consider and approve the unaudited standalone and consolidated financial results of the Bank, for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, which shall be subjected to limited review by the joint statutory auditors,\" it said. ALSO READ | Tech Mahindra Q1 preview: Earnings set to dip QoQ as key segments drag Axis Bank Q1 results expectations: Motilal Oswal Financial Services Sharing expectations on the conservative side, analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services said they project Axis Bank’s earnings to stay under pressure in Q1FY26 amid seasonally high slippages and low margins. MOFSL projected a tepid loan growth of 7.8 per cent Y-o-Y at ₹10.6 trillion, as against a deposit growth of 12.5 per cent Y-o-Y at ₹12 trillion. This, the brokerage said, could lead to Axis Bank’s Q1 net interest income (NII) of ₹13,650 crore, up just 1.5 per cent Y-o-Y over a NII of ₹13,448.2 crore seen in Q1FY25. In Q4FY25, Axis Bank reported a NII of ₹13,810.5 crore. Further, while the brokerage expects cost ratios to remain under control, it cautioned that net interest margin (NIM) and credit costs could remain under pressure. Factoring in higher provisions and slippages, it sees Axis Bank Q1 net profit at ₹5,970 crore, down 1 per cent Y-o-Y from ₹6,034.6 crore. Sequentially, the profit could dip from ₹7,117.5 crore. Motilal Oswal also anticipates marginal decline in asset quality with gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio at 1.4 per cent versus 1.3 per cent Q-o-Q, and NNPA at 0.4 per cent vs 0.3 per cent Q-o-Q. Kotak Institutional Equities Analysts at KIE, meanwhile, anticipate Axis Bank to report muted quarterly earnings in the June 2025 quarter with net profit seen flat (up 0.1 per cent Y-o-Y) at ₹6,041.4 crore in Q1FY26. On a quarterly basis, however, this would be a dip of 15.1 per cent Q-o-Q. Operationally, too, NII is seen rising just 0.7 per cent Y-o-Y, but falling 2 per cent Q-o-Q, to ₹ 13,538.6 crore. Pre-provision operating profit (PPoP), too, is seen at ₹10,412.5 crore, up 3 per cent Y-o-Y from ₹10,106.2 crore, but down 3.2 per cent Q-o-Q from ₹10,752.4 crore. The estimates come on the back of 7 per cent Y-o-Y and flat Q-o-Q loan growth estimates. The brokerage also expects NIM to decline 20 bps Q-o-Q to 3.5 per cent, factoring in the impact of the rate cut cycle. Fee income growth, it said, will be sluggish, reflecting weak loan growth. \"We expect slippages of around ₹6,000 crore (2.3 per cent of loans), mostly led by retail. Key discussion areas would be slippages, especially from unsecured segment, deposit mobilisation, and NIM progression,\" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in its results preview report. Systematix Institutional Research In-line with other brokerages’ views, analysts at Systematix Research believe Axis Bank’s sequential loan growth could be marginally higher than the industry growth. The fall in yield on advances (YoA) will not be completely off set by the fall in cost of deposits (CoD), hence, NIM will witness a contraction Q-o-Q. \"Slippages are also expected to remain elevated, driven by seasonally high agri-slippages. The Q-o-Q growth in provisions may also be optically high as there was a writeback of provisions in the previous quarter (Q4FY25),\" analysts cautioned. Further, weighed by lower fee income and higher wage bill, Axis Bank’s PPoP is seen rising just 3.8 per cent Y-o-Y, but down 2.5 per cent Q-o-Q, to ₹10,485.6 crore in Q1FY26. NII, meanwhile, is seen expanding 2.8 per cent over Q1FY25 and 0.1 per cent over Q4FY25 to ₹13,822.9 crore. Overall, net profit is expected to increase by 4.2 per cent Y-o-Y, but decline 11.6 per cent Q-o-Q, to ₹6,289.2 crore during the quarter under study. Axis Bank reported a net profit of ₹6,034.6 crore in Q1FY25 and ₹7,117.5 crore in Q4FY25. Emkay Global Financial Services This brokerage has shared slightly optimistic result expectations with net profit growth pegged at 6.6 per cent Y-o-Y (down 9.6 per cent Q-o-Q) at ₹6,432.5 crore. While PPoP is projected to grow 3 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹10,411.1 crore, NII is seen up 2.2 per cent to ₹13,746.1 crore. NIM, meanwhile, is seen at 3.8 per cent, down 22bps Y-o-Y and 14 bps Q-o-Q. \"Slower growth, margin contraction, and elevated credit cost could keep earnings in check.

But, its quirky charm cannot completely mask a few noticeable trade-offs", "content": "By now, we have come to expect the unexpected from Nothing. Whether it is earbuds with transparent stems or phones that flash and beep like they are from a cooler, more minimalist future. The new Nothing Phone 3 is no exception. It builds on the familiar transparent aesthetic that the company has proudly owned, but takes bolder risks this time, especially with the rear camera layout and the new Glyph Matrix display. Nothing is also pitching this as its first “true flagship” device. On paper, it checks many of the right boxes: high-refresh AMOLED display, large battery with fast charging, wireless charging, a periscope telephoto lens, and a splash of AI to keep things trendy. But the flagship label brings with it a higher price tag, but more importantly expectations to match. So, does the Phone 3 bring enough to justify its Rs 79,999 asking price? Let us find out: Design and Glyph Matrix As with every Nothing device, the story of the Phone 3 largely revolves around its design. The company has doubled down on its now-signature transparent aesthetic, and this time, it is not just transparent, but also confidently bold. Where the Phone 1 and Phone 2 kept things relatively grounded with more familiar camera layouts, the Phone 3 throws symmetry out the window. If you thought the unusual placement on the Phone 3a Pro hinted at design rebellion, the Phone 3 feels like a full-blown protest. The camera modules on the back are arranged with a kind of chaos that defies logic. At best, it resembles a modern art take on a board game: square housings holding random circular elements that do not quite align. The two main camera sensors, both sitting on the top left and nearly aligned, are especially confounding. That said, love it or hate it, the Phone 3’s design draws attention. Whether it is admiration or confusion, that is up to the observer, but it is unmistakably distinct. In-hand, the phone feels premium. The flat, metallic frame has a solid grip, and the glossy glass back adds just the right amount of sheen. While it carries some heft, the weight is well distributed, making extended use surprisingly comfortable. The practical downsides to this bold aesthetic start to show when the phone leaves your hand. The misaligned camera rings are prone to catching on your pocket contents with keychains being a frequent offender. And on flat surfaces, expect the phone to wobble unpredictably thanks to the varying heights of the camera islands. It is a multi-directional teeter that makes casual table-top use a mild challenge. But then comes the twist: flipping the phone over offers more than just a solution to the wobble. The Phone 3 replaces the familiar Glyph light bars with something more ambitious, the “Glyph Matrix.” This dot-matrix LED display is like a secondary, low-res screen on the back. While it sacrifices the clean minimalist layout of the older Glyph interface, it brings in new tricks. You still get notification-based animations and app-specific glyph cues. But now, you also get quirky additions like emoji-based alerts, mini-games like Spin the Bottle and Rock Paper Scissors, and a stopwatch. Nothing calls these “Glyph Toys” and while they are a fun novelty at first, they may wear thin over time. Still, they add an undeniably playful touch. There is also actual utility in features like the “Glyph Mirror,” which turns the matrix display into a basic viewfinder for taking selfies with the rear camera. No, it is not sharp enough to actually frame your shot, but it helps with alignment and positioning. Navigating through all this is made possible by a small pressure-sensitive button on the back. A light press cycles through glyph toys, while a long press lets you interact with the current one. Surprisingly, the button rarely misfires even when you are gripping the phone tightly, which speaks to thoughtful hardware execution despite the phone’s wild design choices. Display The front of the Nothing Phone 3 looks relatively normal. There is less room here for experimental flourishes, which might explain why Nothing kept it clean and conventional. And it works. The sleek, minimal bezels surrounding the 6.67-inch AMOLED panel make for a modern flagship-worthy appearance, fully in line with Nothing’s claim that the Phone 3 belongs in that tier. Thankfully, the panel is not just about looks. It delivers where it counts. With a resolution of 1260 x 2800, visuals appear sharp and vibrant. Colours are punchy without being overdone, and the display maintains excellent clarity and brightness across various lighting conditions. Nothing claims a peak outdoor brightness of 1600 nits. While I was not able to confirm the exact figure, I had no trouble using the phone in direct sunlight. The panel’s brightness held up well in all kinds of environments, and viewing angles are equally impressive, with very little colour shift when viewed off-axis. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures fluid scrolling and slick animations, which pairs nicely with the Phone 3’s zippy interface. While the panel is not LTPO, it does support dynamic refresh rate adjustments with LTPS technology. In line with its “flagship” positioning, Nothing has also added a few more display customisation options this time. You get two screen colour modes: Alive and Standard, as well as a manual slider to fine-tune colour temperature. There is also a toggle in the Settings app for enabling or disabling “HDR display,” which can help optimise power usage by adjusting brightness during HDR playback. Speaking of which, the Phone 3’s display supports Widevine L1, allowing full-resolution streaming on services like Netflix. While HDR playback does not appear to be supported on Netflix just yet, it does work on compatible YouTube videos. Camera While the display checks almost every box for a device being positioned as a “flagship,” the Nothing Phone 3’s camera performance is a bit trickier to pin down. Let is get the specs out of the way first. The Phone 3 features a triple 50MP setup on the rear: a primary sensor with optical image stabilisation (OIS), a periscopic telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and an ultra-wide angle lens with a 114-degree field of view. Autofocus is present on the primary and telephoto lenses. On the front, you get yet another 50MP sensor, this time with electronic image stabilisation (EIS). In use, the primary camera delivers solid results in good lighting. Detail retention is strong, and colours are generally accurate without being overly punchy or boosted. Dynamic range is decent too. However, the Phone 3 struggles in challenging lighting, occasionally blowing out highlights or crushing shadows, leading to loss of detail in darker or brighter parts of the image. It takes good photos overall, but colour accuracy and light handling still need polishing to bring it closer to what other flagship phones are doing. The periscopic telephoto is capable of 3x optical zoom (70mm equivalent), and it performs well. Colours remain consistent with the main sensor, and details are crisp. What is especially nice is that this telephoto lens can double as a macro camera – you can capture close-ups without needing to physically get closer, and thanks to OIS and autofocus, it stays sharp even with small hand movements. Portrait shots, however, are a bit hit or miss. Whether taken from the primary or telephoto lens, subject separation can feel off, with edge detection occasionally failing or creating uneven blur. Oddly enough, I found myself preferring the portrait output from the more affordable Phone 3a Pro. Moving to the ultra-wide, the colour profile noticeably shifts as it pushes vibrancy more aggressively, especially in daylight. Detail retention is still solid, but the ultra-wide also brings with it a more dramatic fisheye effect that can distort crowded or geometric scenes like buildings and streets. It is fun, but not always usable. On the front, the camera produces decent shots with natural-looking skin tones and facial detail, even in low light. That said, the absence of autofocus here feels like a missed opportunity at this price point. For video, all four cameras, including the front, support 4K recording at up to 60fps, which is a nice touch. However, there is no option for 4K slo-mo capture, which might disappoint some content creators. Performance There has been plenty of chatter about Nothing opting for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead of the top-tier Snapdragon 8 Elite for its first “true flagship.” In day-to-day use, the decision does not feel like a downgrade. The Phone 3 handles multitasking with ease, switching between apps without breaking a sweat. Graphic-intensive games like Real Racing 3 run smoothly at the highest settings, with no visible stutter or frame drops. Even during extended gaming sessions or prolonged 4K video recordings, performance remains steady. Yes, the back of the phone does get warm, especially around the camera module, but it never crosses into uncomfortable territory, nor does it impact overall performance. For most users, this chipset choice will feel more than adequate, unless you are specifically chasing benchmark records. From price-to-performance optics, Snapdragon 8 Elite would have been a better fit for the Phone 3. Software and AI The Android-based Nothing OS has consistently been one of the most enjoyable aspects of using a Nothing phone, and the Phone 3 carries forward that legacy. The interface remains clean, responsive, and highly customisable, letting users switch between a stock Android feel or lean into Nothing’s signature dot-matrix aesthetics. While the core software experience aligns with what you would find on recent Nothing devices, the Phone 3 introduces a few new AI tricks up its sleeve. Nothing’s customisable hardware key, the Essential Key, which debuted with the Phone 3a and 3a Pro, returns on the Phone 3. Pressing it launches the Essential Space app, a sort of digital hub where you can save screenshots, voice notes, text, and more. It also integrates smart features like automatic categorisation and reminder prompts based on saved content. Another fresh addition is Essential Search, a global search bar embedded into the app drawer. It allows you to search for local content like files and images using keywords. It does not stop there, you can also type general queries such as “Who won the FIFA Club World Cup 2025,” and the phone will pull concise web results directly into the interface. It even handles quick tasks like solving equations without the need to open a separate calculator app. A particularly noteworthy AI feature is Flip to Record, which acts as a contextual meeting notes tool. By holding the Essential Key and flipping the phone, you can initiate a smart transcription tool that records your meeting and generates a summarised breakdown. Double-pressing the Essential Key also records voice snippets with transcription. In my usage, transcriptions were accurate and the feature worked consistently as intended. Battery The Nothing Phone 3 packs a sizeable 5500mAh battery, and it comfortably delivers a full day of usage, often stretching into a second day with moderate use. Battery anxiety is not something you will be dealing with much here. Charging has also seen a meaningful upgrade, with support for 65W wired charging. While a charger is not included in the box, using a 67W charger I had, I was able to go from 2 per cent to a full charge in just under an hour. What is also good to see is 15W wireless charging support, which adds flexibility and brings the Phone 3 closer in line with other flagships. Verdict The Nothing Phone 3 continues Nothing’s tradition of making phones that stand out, not just with their designs, but with their attitude. It is bold, quirky, and not afraid to embrace eccentricity, whether it is the Glyph Matrix pulling notification duty with dot animations or the chaotic rear camera layout that looks like a board game gone rogue. Underneath all that flair, the Phone 3 does feel and perform like a flagship in most day-to-day scenarios. The Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 may not be Qualcomm’s top-tier chip, but Nothing has optimised it well enough that you likely will not notice performance drop. Battery life is excellent, the software remains delightfully minimal and fast, and the AI additions are smartly integrated rather than shoved in for the sake of a checklist. But for all its polish, the Phone 3 does not quite escape some flagship expectations. Camera performance, especially in portraits and low-light scenarios, lags behind similarly priced rivals. And at a starting price of Rs 79,999, that is not a small miss. You also start to notice that the flashy rear display and Glyph toys, while fun and functional in small bursts, may not hold long-term value for every user. Ultimately, the Phone 3 is a well-rounded and memorable device, but it walks a fine line between form and function. It is a phone that dares to be different, but at this price point, it also invites fair scrutiny where all the hype Nothing built around it lays bare and exposes more focus on style than on substance.

Meanwhile, recently, the Delhi High Court passed an interim order directing Patanjali Ayurved to take down advertisements that allegedly disparage Dabur's chyawanprash products. This came in response to a suit filed by Dabur India Ltd in December 2024, accusing Patanjali Ayurved of making misleading claims about its flagship Ayurvedic product. Justice Mini Pushkarna issued the order after finding that the contested advertisements were problematic under the law governing commercial speech and product representation. The case stems from an advertisement featuring Patanjali Ayurved’s co-founder Ramdev, who is shown casting doubt on the authenticity of competing Chyawanprash brands. According to the lawsuit, the ad shows that only Patanjali’s Chyawanprash is \"original\", while others are shown as lacking the requisite Ayurvedic and Vedic knowledge to manufacture authentic formulations.

This marks one of the largest and most ambitious government-level adoptions of artificial intelligence (AI) in the world. San Francisco’s Mayor, Daniel Lurie, confirmed on Monday (local time) that employees across all city departments, including healthcare workers, social service staff, and administrative personnel, will now have access to Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, an AI assistant powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o model. This tool will help reduce time spent on routine administrative tasks like data analysis, drafting reports, and translating content into over 40 languages. With this move, San Francisco aims to boost efficiency and allow workers to spend more time directly serving residents. “San Francisco is the global home of AI, and now we’re putting that innovation to work,” said Mayor Lurie. “We’re showing the world how governments can use technology to deliver better results.” What is Microsoft Copilot Chat? Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat is a smart assistant built into popular workplace tools such as Word, Excel, and Outlook. With the help of AI, it can draft emails, summarise long documents, and even help translate languages. These are all repetitive tasks that often consume hours of government workers’ time. AI tools helped workers save up to five hours a week, the city found during its six-month pilot programme with 2,000 employees. It was especially effective in 311 public service lines (similar to helplines in India), improving response times for complaints related to waste management, homelessness, and multilingual service needs. The city is now launching a five-week training programme for employees. This includes live workshops, public sector-specific courses, and support from InnovateUS, a nonprofit that focuses on preparing government staff for digital transformation. Security and ethics top priorities in AI adoption The platform will run on Microsoft’s secure government cloud, with strict data protection measures. Updated AI guidelines, released on July 8, ensure that all AI use remains transparent and responsible. Every department must disclose how it is using AI, and staff remain accountable for any AI-generated content they share. “AI is here, and San Francisco is meeting the moment,” said Michael Makstman, the city’s Chief Information Officer. “We’re not just talking about innovation—we’re doing it responsibly and at scale.” How is the govt adapting artificial intelligence? San Francisco is also applying AI in other areas like: - Improving traffic safety through predictive analytics - Connecting homeless individuals with services faster - Simplifying permit approvals, similar to India’s building and trade license processes The city plans to build on feedback from employees to improve AI tools over time. It hopes to set an example for governments leveraging AI. “As our city and the world embrace AI technology, San Francisco is setting the standard for how local government can responsibly do the same,” Mayor Lurie said. OpenAI offer custom AI This development also comes at a time when OpenAI, the creator of GPT-4o, has begun offering highly customised AI services starting at $10 million, with early clients including the US Department of Defence and Southeast Asia's super app Grab. As part of this strategy, OpenAI is embedding forward-deployed engineers (within organisations to tailor GPT-4o to specific needs, ranging from workflow automation to advanced chatbots.

India became a major importer of Russian oil since the invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. More than a third of overall purchases have been from the Opec+ producer this year, compared with less than 1 per cent prior to the war, according to data from Kpler. China’s imports have also climbed over the same period. Still, the initial reaction from the market to Trump’s remarks was nonchalance. Global benchmark Brent fell almost 2 per cent to close below $70 a barrel on Monday, suggesting little concern around the potential impact to crude flows. Trump said penalties would come in the form of “secondary tariffs,” without providing details, and would be implemented in 50 days if Russia doesn’t end hostilities with Ukraine. Matt Whitaker, the US ambassador to Nato, said the action effectively represents sanctions on nations buying Russian oil. Whitaker specifically cited India and China. Russian flows to India reached 2.1 million barrels a day in June, the biggest monthly intake in nearly a year, and close to the record set in May 2023, data from Kpler show. China’s purchases haven’t accelerated at the same pace, but have been consistently above 1 million barrels a day since the war. “If push really comes to shove, and India cannot buy any crude oil from the Russian system, then India has optionality with the other Opec members,” said Mukesh Sahdev, head of commodity markets at Rystad Energy A/S. But “it will be at a higher cost,” he added. Barrels from the Middle East and Africa could help plug the gap of lost Russian supply, but the crude would be more expensive. Imports from Saudi Arabia in May were $5 a barrel higher than those from Russia, while shipments from Iraq were about 50 cents more pricey, according to official data from India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "12:19 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T12:19:00", "topics": ["Donald Trump", "Russia Ukraine Conflict", "Trump tariffs", "oil export", "India-Russia ties", "China"], "author": "Bloomberg", "premium": "False"}

As the head of a new interim government, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus promised to hold a credible election to return to democracy, initiate electoral and constitutional reforms and restore peace on the streets after hundreds were killed in weeks of violence that began on July 15, 2024. A year later, the Yunus-led administration has struggled to contain the fallout of the uprising. Bangladesh finds itself mired in a growing political uncertainty, religious polarisation and a challenging law-and-order situation. Here's what to know about Bangladesh a year after the protests that toppled Hasina. Chaotic political landscape Uncertainty about the future of democracy looms large in Bangladesh. The student protesters who toppled Hasina formed a new political party, promising to break the overwhelming influence of two major dynastic political parties the Bangladesh Nationalists Party, or BNP, and Hasina's Awami League. But the party's opponents have accused it of being close to the Yunus-led administration and creating chaos for political mileage by using state institutions. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's political landscape has further fragmented after the country's largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, returned to politics more than a decade after it was suppressed by Hasina's government. Aligned with the student-led party, it's trying to fill the vacuum left by the Awami League, which was banned in May. Its leader, Hasina, is facing trial for crimes against humanity. The strength of Jamaat-e-Islami, which opposed Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971, is unknown. Both BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami party are now at loggerheads over establishing supremacy within the administration and judiciary, and even university campuses. They are also differing over the timing of a new parliamentary election. Yunus has announced that the polls would be held in April next year, but poor law and order situation and a lack of clear-cut political consensus over it have created confusion. The chief of Bangladesh's military also wanted an election in December this year a stance Yunus didn't like. Post-revolution honeymoons often don't last long, and Bangladesh is no exception, says Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and senior fellow of Asia Pacific Foundation. The interim government faced massive expectations to restore democracy and prosperity. But this is especially difficult to do as an unelected government without a public mandate.\" Yunus wants reforms before election Yunus has delayed an election because he wants reforms from changes to the constitution and elections to the judiciary and police. Discussions with political parties, except Hasina's Awami League, are ongoing. Some of the reforms include putting a limit on how many times a person can become the prime minister, introduction of a two-tier parliament, and appointment of a chief justice. There appears to be little consensus over some basic reforms. While both the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami parties have agreed to some of them with conditions, other proposals for basic constitutional reforms have become a sticking point. The Jamaat-e-Islami also wants to give the interim government more time to complete reforms before heading into polls, while BNP has been calling for an early election. The student-led party mostly follows the pattern of the Jamaat-e-Islami party. Kugelman says the issue of reforms was meant to unite the country, but has instead become a flashpoint. There's a divide between those that want to see through reforms and give them more time, and those that feel it's time to wrap things up and focus on elections, he says. Human rights and the rise of Islamists Human rights in Bangladesh have remained a serious concern under Yunus. Minority groups, especially Hindus, have blamed his administration for failing to protect them adequately. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council says minority Hindus and others have been targeted in hundreds of attacks over the last year. Hasina's party has also blamed the interim government for arresting tens of thousands of its supporters. The Yunus-led administration denies these allegations. Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, says while the interim government has stopped enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions that had occurred under the Hasina government, there has been little progress on lasting security sector reforms or to deliver on the pledge to create robust, independent institutions. Meanwhile, Islamist factions some of whom have proposed changes to women's rights and demanded introduction of Sharia law are vying for power. Many of them are planning to build alliances with bigger parties like the BNP or the Jamaat-e-Islami. Such factions have historically struggled to gain significant electoral support despite Bangladesh being a Muslim majority, and their rise is expected to further fragment the country's political landscape. Diplomatic pivot and balancing with global powers During Hasina's 15-year rule, Bangladesh was India's closest partner in South Asia. After her ouster, the Yunus-led administration has moved closer to China. Yunus' first state visit was to China in March, a trip that saw him secure investments, loans and grants. Globally, Yunus seems to have strong backing from the West and the United Nations, and it appears Bangladesh will continue its foreign policy, which has long tried to find a balance between multiple foreign powers. But Kugelman says the country's biggest challenge may be the Trump factor. In January, the Trump administration suspended USAID funds to Bangladesh, which had sought significant levels of US support during a critical rebuild period post Hasina's ouster. Dhaka must now reframe its relations with an unconventional US administration that will largely view Bangladesh through a commercial lens, Kugelman says.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "12:00 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T12:00:00", "topics": ["Bangladesh", "Bangladesh election", "Muhammad Yunus", "Sheikh Hasina"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

According to his biography, he was unable to walk until the age of five, but later built resilience working on farms and credited his strength to family support and faith. Fauja Singh moved to London in 1993 after the death of his wife Gian Kaur, to live with one of his sons. It was during this time that he took up long walks and running in public parks—habits that would spark an extraordinary late-in-life athletic career. Record-breaking marathon journey In 2000, at the age of 89, Singh ran his first marathon—the London Marathon—after meeting coach Harmandar Singh. Between 2000 and 2011, he completed nine full marathons, including six London Marathons, two Toronto Marathons, and the New York Marathon. He became the first person aged 100 to finish a full marathon, completing the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in 2011 in 8 hours and 11 minutes. Singh also participated in 10-km races globally, including in Hong Kong and Lahore. His participation in the Lahore event drew praise from then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. Honours and legacy Fauja Singh was honoured with the Ellis Island Medal of Honour by the National Ethnic Coalition in the US in 2013.

Expressing his grief over the death of the college student, Patnaik in a long social media post said: \"It is even more disturbing to think how a failed system can take someone's life. The most painful part is that this was not an accident, but rather the result of a system that remained silent instead of helping. Struggling for justice, the girl ultimately closed her eyes.\" With great courage, Patnaik said the student had written to the college principal, informing them about the sexual harassment she had faced. \"Even after being ignored by the college authorities, she did not give up. To seek justice, she reached out to the Higher Education minister, the Chief Minister's office, and even a Union minister,\" Patnaik said. The former chief minister said the brave student also personally met the Balasore MP to share her plight. \"If even one person had taken responsibility and intervened personally, perhaps the girl's life could have been saved. She did not lose her life solely due to physical trauma but also because of the negligence of the state government, which left her alone in her struggle,\" Patnaik said. The BJD president said: \"The entire sequence of events reveals that this is nothing less than institutional betrayala planned injustice. I once again urge the Honourable Governor to ensure that not only the college authorities but also those in power, who failed to take any action despite the victim's desperate pleas, are held accountable.\" \"May the departed soul find eternal peace. I pray once again to Lord Jagannath to grant strength and courage to the family members to face this immense sorrow. Om Shanti,\" Patnaik said in a social media post. The second-year B.Ed student of Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College, Balasore died on Monday night at AIIMS-Bhubaneswar after fighting for her life for three days. She set herself on fire on the campus on Saturday over alleged inaction against a professor who allegedly sexually harassed her. She had suffered 95 per cent burns.

Track LIVE Stock Market Updates Here Sun Pharma launches hair loss drug The pharma major launched Leqselvi in the US, a new medicine for severe alopecia areata -- a condition in which the immune system attacks hair follicles, leading to hair loss on the scalp as well as other parts of the body. The delay in Sun Pharma's launch of Leqselvi in the US was caused by a patent infringement case, which was later settled in a US court with Incyte Corp. The drug underwent two clinical trials, THRIVE-AA1 and THRIVE-AA2, involving 1,223 adults between 18 and 65 years of age. The trials were conducted in the US, Canada, and Europe. Sun Pharmaceutical is also offering a 'Leqselvi Support Program' to help patients access the medicine. Hair regrowth was measured over a period of 24 weeks using a scoring system known as the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT), according to the company's statement. “Leqselvi is an important step forward for people living with severe alopecia areata,” said Richard Ascroft, CEO of Sun Pharma North America. Elera Capital estimates that Leqselvi could become a $200-300 million opportunity over the next 3-5 years, potentially emerging as Sun Pharma’s second-largest product after Ilumya.

Here is what players can expect from the BGMI 3.9 update. BGMI 3.9 update: Release timeline According to a report by Digit, the BGMI 3.9 upgrade is likely to be released on July 16, 2025, at roughly 6:30 AM for Android and 9:00 AM for iOS. Krafton, however, has not yet announced an exact date for the release. BGMI 3.9 update: What to expect The BGMI 3.9 update may be released on July 16, bringing several gameplay changes and features. According to BGMI’s YouTube video, the biggest addition is a Transformers crossover, where players can use Spacebridge Beacons found in maps like Erangel and Livik to call in Optimus Prime or Megatron (Transformers characters). These characters can switch between robot and vehicle forms and use special attacks. The YouTube video further highlights that there’s also a new Hoverboard in the game which in a way replaces the ODM gear found in the BGMI 3.8 update. It can be used for quicker movement and mid-air combat, but it has a cooldown timer to avoid overuse. The update is further set to introduce new zones like Neon Town and Neon Outpost, which have brighter visuals, loot bots that drop gear, and even a burger shop that restores your boost bar. According to a report by India Today Gaming, Zombie Mode is also making a return — this time with larger enemies like an Ice Dragon and Ink Blaster, which will likely require more coordinated team efforts to take down. On the rewards side, expect new loot crates, along with Transformers-themed skins and emotes. For users on lower-end devices, a new Super Smooth mode will reportedly be added to improve performance.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "11:55 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T11:55:00", "topics": ["Gaming", "online gaming", "online games", "PUBG"], "author": "Aashish Kumar Shrivastava", "premium": "False"}

The IT giant's stock fell as much as 4.31 per cent during the day to ₹1,550 per share, the biggest intraday fall since April 7 this year. The stock pared gains to trade 3 per cent lower at ₹1,569.7 apiece, compared to a 0.55 per cent advance in Nifty 50 as of 11:45 AM. HCL Tech Q1FY26 results The IT services firm reported a net profit of ₹3,843 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026 (Q1-FY26), down 9.72 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y). On a sequential basis, profit was down 10.7 per cent. The company reported 3.7 per cent constant-currency (CC) revenue growth for the April-June quarter. Revenue from financial services was up 6.8 per cent, technology 13.7 per cent, and telecommunications 13 per cent. The manufacturing and life sciences verticals were down 1 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. HCL Tech FY26 guidance HCL expects revenue to grow 3-5 per cent on a CC basis for the full year, up from 2-5 per cent it had projected in April. However, the firm cut its Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin guidance to 17-18 per cent from 18-19 per cent earlier. The company said the margins would be impacted due to restructuring. HCL Tech management commentary “The macro environment remained stable from an overall perspective, with some variations across verticals, but the overall situation did not deteriorate as feared at the start of the quarter,” said C Vijayakumar, chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director, at a news conference. “We won a large consolidation deal in financial services this quarter, which is not accounted for in the total contract value (TCV) for the first quarter,” Vijayakumar added. The value of the new deal bookings stood at $1.81 billion. Analysts on HCL results Nuvama Institutional Equities said that weak margins in Q1-FY26 and a guidance cut have left HCLTech with almost no earnings per share (EPS) growth expected for FY26. \"While we continue to favour its strong revenue growth, making it the fastest-growing among the top five IT firms, earnings have been impacted by lower margin expectations.\" Nuvama downgraded the stock to 'hold' and said that it now trades at a slight premium to TCS and Infosys, limiting further upside. Emkay Global noted that HCLTech’s Q1FY26 operating performance was weaker than expected, primarily due to a margin miss, although revenue was in line. The brokerage lowered its FY26-28 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 3-7 per cent, factoring in the Q1 results and the margin guidance cut. It retained ‘Reduce’ rating and revised the target price by around 5 per cent to ₹1,660. Nomura cut its FY26-27 EPS estimates by around 2-5 per cent and slashed the target price to ₹1,810 (from ₹1,840 earlier). \"We expect the street to look past the near-term margin miss, as margins are likely to recover in FY27, and instead focus on HCLTech’s continued revenue outperformance.\" JPMorgan slashed its ratings on HCL Tech to 'Neutral', while Jefferies raised it to 'Buy', according to reports. HCL Tech share price history Shares of the company fell for the seventh straight day on Tuesday and currently trade at 15 times the average 30-day trading volume, according to Bloomberg.

CATCH STOCK MARKET LATEST UPDATES TODAY LIVE Rallis India Q1 results Rallis India for the April-June 2025 quarter (Q1FY26) reported revenue of ₹957 crore, up 22 per cent year-on-year (YoY), led by volume led growth in both crop care and seeds businesses. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 56.3 per cent at ₹150 crore, while margins came at 15.7 per cent, (up by ~300 bps YoY), driven by volume led growth and moderated fixed cost. Profit after tax stood at ₹95 crore in Q1FY26 as compared to ₹48 crore in Q1FY25. The management has attributed strong performance during the quarter to an early onset of monsoon in the domestic market and recovery in volumes in few products. The growth was indeed driven by volumes thus nullifying the lower GPM impact (lowest in the last 9 quarters). The management remains cautiously optimistic about the coming quarters for the domestic market and gradual recovery in the exports market. Agri - Industry overview With a growing consumer base, the agri-inputs sector stands poised to benefit from a shift towards more efficient, sustainable practices. Opportunities remain abound in developing advanced fertilizers, bio-based solutions and precision agriculture technologies that can increase crop yields while reducing environmental impact. The Asia-Pacific (APAC) crop protection market is expected to grow from $15.5 billion in 2024 to $18.8 billion by 2029, contributing 25.2 per cent to the global market's incremental growth during this period. The region's large and growing population is driving agricultural intensification. This increases the need for effective crop protection solutions to improve yields, said Sharda Cropchem said in its FY25 annual report. Meanwhile, according to Elara Capital, agrochemicals companies, domestic-dependent as well as exports-driven, are likely to see healthy volume growth. Domestic branded companies’ top-line growth would be driven by robust placement, due to expectations of normal Monsoon driving healthy agrochemicals demand. If the timing and distribution of Monsoon is favorable, the industry is likely to see sharp consumption growth at the farm level. On the exports side, with destocking largely over globally, fresh demand is driving growth in the international business for our coverage universe. “Tactically, for the quarter, we prefer domestic agrochemical companies, as we believe, domestic agrochemicals demand can see a significant upswing if the timing and distribution of Monsoon is in balance. Fertilizer companies have seen a healthy run-up in the stock price in the range of 10 per cent-35 per cent in the past three months, and have yet to factor in near-term risk, due to rising raw material prices, in our view,” the brokerage firm said in sector quarterly preview.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "11:39 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T11:39:00", "topics": ["Buzzing stocks", "stock market trading", "agricultural sector", "Strong monsoons", "Rallis India", "Deepak Fertilisers & Chemicals", "RCF", "Paradeep Phosphates Ltd", "Coromandel International", "The Smart Investor"], "author": "Deepak Korgaonkar", "premium": "False"}

This rise was primarily fuelled by steady demand from Global Capability Centres (GCCs), renewed interest in third-party IT services, and the growing popularity of flexible workspaces, according to data from Knight Frank India. Grade A offices remain a priority Large companies have been focusing on acquiring high-quality, future-ready Grade A office spaces to support their long-term plans. Bengaluru led the leasing activity, followed by Delhi-NCR and Pune. As demand continues to surpass new supply, vacancy rates have been falling, and rental prices have risen in key markets. This trend reflects strong occupier confidence and suggests that India’s commercial office sector is poised for further growth in the latter half of the year. Bengaluru leads with record absorption Bengaluru recorded its highest-ever leasing for a half-year period, absorbing 18.2 million square feet of space. The majority of this—55 per cent—was taken up by GCCs. Notably, 46 per cent of the area leased was through pre-commitments, reflecting robust demand for ready-to-use office spaces and a push from tenants to secure future inventory early. Mixed performance across other metros Only Mumbai and Ahmedabad saw a decline in office leasing volumes in the first half of 2025, largely due to a high base in the previous year. In Mumbai, leasing dropped by 5 per cent to 5.5 million square feet, while Ahmedabad recorded a 51 per cent fall, leasing just 0.8 million square feet between January and June. In contrast, Pune reported a 17 per cent increase, reaching 5.1 million square feet. Delhi-NCR registered a 27.5 per cent growth, touching 7.2 million square feet.

The former Republican congressman is set to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing, with Trump looking to fill his remaining Cabinet position after months of delay, including the withdrawal of the previous nominee. The hearing will provide senators with the first opportunity to grill Waltz over revelations in March that he added The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an unclassified messaging app that was used to discuss planning for strikes on Houthi militants in Yemen. Waltz took responsibility even as criticism mounted against Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who shared the sensitive plans in the chat that included several other high-level national security officials. Hegseth shared the same information in another Signal chat that included family, but Trump has made clear Hegseth has his support. Waltz was removed as national security adviser in May replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and nominated for the UN role. Trump praised Waltz in the announcement, saying, From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. The United Nations is facing major changes If confirmed, Waltz would be coming to the UN at a moment of great change. The world body is reeling from Trump's decision to slash foreign assistance affecting its humanitarian aid agencies and it anticipates US funding cuts to the UN annual budget. Under an America First foreign policy realignment, the White House has asserted that \"some of the UN's agencies and bodies have drifted from their founding mission and act contrary to the interests of the United States while attacking our allies and propagating anti-Semitism. With America being the largest United Nations donor, cutting US funding to the UN budget would greatly impair operations. Facing financial instability, the UN has spent months shedding jobs and consolidating projects while beginning to tackle long-delayed reforms. The UN is also facing growing frustration over what critics describe as a lack of efficiency and power in delivering on its mandate to end conflict and prevent wars. John Bolton, a former US ambassador to the UN who was also national security adviser during Trump's first term, was critical of the current state of the UN. It's probably in the worst shape it's been in since it was founded, Bolton, now an outspoken Trump critic, recently told The Associated Press. Waltz has been meeting with senators Waltz spent the last several weeks meeting with Democrats and Republicans on the Foreign Affairs committee. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Monday that she and Waltz discussed a wide range of issues, including whether the Trump administration would use the UN to strengthen alliances and combat Chinese influence. I asked him questions about Signalgate,' but I also talked to him about how we are going to sway other nations within the United Nations to our side, in light of how much influence the PRC is having on other nations, the Illinois senator said, using an acronym for the People's Republic of China. Even with Democratic opposition, Waltz only needs a majority in the 53-47 Senate, which Republicans control. He'll be fine. Mike won't have any issues, said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. I mean, the Democrats are gonna do their thing. Whatever. Mike's used to taking incoming fire. It is unclear how Waltz would approach the job. Trump's first nominee, Rep. Elise Stefanik, had built a track record in Congress of criticising the UN She vowed during her confirmation hearing in January to combat what she called antisemitism at the world body and lead a review of US funding. She was expected to be confirmed, but Trump abruptly withdrew her nomination in March, citing risks to the GOP's historically slim House majority. At the time, the loss of a mere handful of seats could have swung the House majority to Democrats and derailed their recently successful efforts to enact Trump's sweeping agenda. Waltz is still on the White House payroll Waltz, whose Florida House seat was filled during a special election earlier this year, has spent the last few months on the White House payroll despite being removed as national security adviser.

The bullet train project recently achieved a major milestone by completing 310 km of viaduct construction. Track laying, construction of overhead electrical wires, stations, and bridges are going on at a rapid pace. The construction work in Maharashtra has also picked up pace. In parallel, the progress on the procurement of systems for operations and control is also going well, the release highlighted. In the spirit of strategic partnership between Japan and India, the Japanese government has agreed to introduce E10 Shinkansen trains in the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet train project. It is noteworthy that E10 will be introduced simultaneously in India and Japan, as per the release. The entire 508 km corridor is being developed with Japanese Shinkansen technology. It will set new benchmarks for speed, safety, and reliability. This reflects the deep strategic and technological cooperation between India and Japan. Civil works are progressing at a rapid pace across the alignment. A 310 km viaduct is constructed. 15 river bridges are completed, and four are in the advanced stages of construction. Out of 12 stations, five are completed and 3 more are now reaching completion stage. The station at BKC is an engineering marvel. The station will be located 32.5 m below ground, and the foundation is designed to support the construction of a 95 m high building above ground. The success of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail (MAHSR) project is laying the foundation for future bullet train corridors in India. Future corridors are also under active consideration.

The opposition party also stressed that it is essential to build a national consensus on the critical security and economic challenges arising from China's rise as the world's leading manufacturing power and its position as the second-largest economy. Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh pointed out that in his July 14 meeting with China's Vice President Han Zheng, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that the India-China bilateral relationship \"has been steadily improving since the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan last October\" and that \"continued normalisation of our ties can produce mutually beneficial outcomes\". \"Perhaps we should remind the EAM of recent developments in bilateral ties since the PM's last tete-a-tete with President Xi: China gave total support to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, turning it into a testing ground for network-centric warfare and weapon systems such as the J-10C fighter and PL-15E air-to-air missile and assorted drones,\" he said in a statement. Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Rahul R Singh has stated that India fought three adversaries in Sindoor, including China that gave Pakistan \"live inputs\" i.e. real time intelligence on Indian military operations, Ramesh said. Pakistan is likely to acquire Chinese J-35 stealth fighters in the near future, he pointed out. China has restricted exports to India of critical materials like rare-earth magnets, speciality fertilisers, and tunnel-boring machines for infrastructure projects, Ramesh said. Important sectors like telecoms, pharmaceuticals, and electronics remain critically dependent on Chinese imports, even as the trade deficit with China reaches a record USD 99.2 billion, he said. Ramesh said hundreds of Chinese workers have departed from India's Foxconn facilities, potentially impeding India's attempt to become an alternative global supplier of Apple smart phones. When are the External Affairs Minister and Prime Minister Modi going to take the people of India into confidence and hold a detailed debate on China in Parliament -- as the Congress has been calling for since 2020, he said. The Congress hopes that the prime minister will finally agree to such a discussion and break the five-year drought in the forthcoming Monsoon session of Parliament, Ramesh said. \"If Parliament could debate the border situation in November 1962 when the Chinese invasion was at its peak, why cannot we discuss now, especially given that both sides appear to want renormalisation (albeit without necessarily restoring the May 2020 status,quo on the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh)?\" the Congress leader said in his statement. It is essential to build a national consensus on the critical security and economic challenges arising from China's rise as the world's leading manufacturing power and its position as the second-largest economy, one that may well surpass the United States within a decade, Ramesh said. His remarks came a day after Jaishankar, during his talks with Yi, said India and China should build on \"good progress\" in normalising bilateral ties to address border-related issues, including de-escalation, and it is essential to avoid \"restrictive trade measures and roadblocks\". Jaishankar also held talks with Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and conveyed to him that continued normalisation of bilateral ties can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "10:30 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T10:30:00", "topics": ["BJP", "Congress", "Monsoon session of Parliament", "Jairam Ramesh"], "author": "Press Trust of India", "premium": "False"}

On a monthly basis, prices likely rose 0.3 per cent from May to June", "content": "Inflation likely accelerated in June as sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports may have pushed up prices for electronics, appliances, and other goods, economists forecast. Consumer prices probably rose 2.6 per cent last month from a year ago, up from an annual increase of 2.4 per cent in May, according to data provider FactSet. The Labour Department will issue its inflation report at 8:30 a.m. eastern. On a monthly basis, prices likely rose 0.3 per cent from May to June, the largest increase since January, economists project. Worsening inflation could pose a political challenge for President Donald Trump, who promised during last year's presidential campaign to immediately lower costs. The sharp inflation spike of 2022-2023 was the worst in four decades and soured most Americans on former president Joe Biden's handling of the economy. Faster price increases would also likely underscore the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut its short-term interest rate, as Trump is loudly demanding. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, inflation is forecast to have risen 3 per cent in June from a year earlier, up from a 2.8 per cent rise in May. On a monthly basis, it is also expected to have picked up 0.3 per cent from May to June, according to FactSet. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better sense of where inflation is headed. Trump has imposed sweeping duties of 10 per cent on all imports, plus 50 per cent levies on steel and aluminum, 30 per cent on goods from China, and 25 per cent on imported cars. Just last week the president threatened to hit the European Union with a new 30 per cent tariff starting Aug 1. So far, the tariffs haven't noticeably pushed up inflation, which has been mild for the past four months. Core inflation has fallen from 3.3 per cent in January to 2.8 per cent in May, though that is still above the Fed's 2 per cent target. If inflation in June is much weaker than economists forecast, Trump will likely renew his demands that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell immediately reduce borrowing costs. Powell and other Fed officials have emphasized that they want to see how the economy evolves as the tariffs take effect before cutting their key short-term rate. The Fed chair has said that the duties could both push up prices and slow the economy, a tricky combination for the central bank since higher costs would typically lead the Fed to hike rates while a weaker economy often spurs it to reduce them. Trump on Monday said that Powell has been terrible and doesn't know what the hell he's doing. The president added that the economy was doing well despite Powell's refusal to reduce rates, but it would be nice if there were rate cuts because people would be able to buy housing a lot easier. Last week, White House officials also attacked Powell for cost overruns on the years-long renovation of two Fed buildings, which are now slated to cost $2.5 billion, roughly one-third more than originally budgeted. While Trump legally can't fire Powell just because he disagrees with his interest rate decisions, the Supreme Court has signaled, he may be able to do so for cause, such as misconduct or mismanagement. While inflation was mild in May, there were already signs in last month's report that tariffs were starting to have some impact. The cost of furniture, appliances, toys, and tools rose, though those increases were offset by falling prices for airfares, hotels, and muted rises in rental costs. Some companies have said they have or plan to raise prices as a result of the tariffs, including Walmart, the world's largest retailer. Automaker Mitsubishi said last month that it was lifting prices by an average of 2.1 per cent in response to the duties, and Nike has said it would implement surgical price hikes to offset tariff costs. But many companies have been able to postpone or avoid price increases, after building up their stockpiles of goods this spring to get ahead of the duties. Other companies may have refrained from lifting prices while they wait to see whether the U.S. is able to reach trade deals with other countries that lower the duties.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "10:26 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T10:26:00", "topics": ["Trump tariffs", "United States", "US Inflation"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

Shifa Hospital in Gaza City also received 12 bodies, including three children and two women, after a series of strikes in the north, according to the hospital's director, Dr. Mohammed Abu Selmia. Al-Awda Hospital reported seven killed and 11 wounded in strikes in central Gaza. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in densely populated areas. Separately, three Israeli soldiers were killed in northern Gaza, according to the military. A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said on Monday that they died in an explosion in their tank, apparently after it was hit by an anti-tank missile, though the incident was still being examined. UN agencies, including those providing food and health care, reiterated a warning made at the weekend that without adequate fuel, they \"will likely be forced to stop their operations entirely\". In a joint statement, they said that hospitals are already going dark and ambulances can no longer move. Without fuel, transport, water production, sanitation and telecommunications will shut down and bakeries and community kitchens cannot operate, they said. The agencies confirmed that some 1,50,000 litres of fuel entered Gaza last week the first delivery in 130 days. But they said it is \"a small fraction of what is needed each day to keep daily life and critical aid operations running\". \"The United Nations agencies and humanitarian partners cannot overstate the urgency of this moment: fuel must be allowed into Gaza in sufficient quantities and consistently to sustain life-saving operations,\" they said. The agencies signing the statement were the UN humanitarian office OCHA, food agency WFP, health organisation WHO, children's agency UNICEF, the agency helping Palestinian refugees UNRWA, population agency UNFPA, development agency UNDP, and UNOPS which oversees procurement and provides management services. Israel's military said a June 19 strike killed Muhammad Nasr Ali Quneita, a senior Hamas militant who it said had taken part in the October 7, 2023, attack and held hostage Emily Damari, a dual Israeli-British citizen, in his home at the start of the war. There was no comment from Hamas and no independent confirmation. Thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 people, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. The militants are still holding 50 hostages, less than half of them believed to be alive. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 58,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which has said women and children make up more than half of the dead. It does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its tally. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and is led by medical professionals. The United Nations and other experts consider its figures to be the most reliable count of war casualties. Israel's air and ground war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and driven some 90 per cent of the population from their homes. Aid groups say they have struggled to bring in food and other assistance because of Israeli military restrictions and the breakdown of law and order, and experts have warned of famine. Israel's Knesset meanwhile voted to expel a prominent Arab lawmaker, but the measure failed to pass the threshold of 90 votes in the 120-member assembly. Seventy-three members voted in favour. The attempt to remove Ayman Odeh from parliament was related to a social media post in January in which he welcomed the release of both Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners in a Gaza ceasefire. The prisoners released in the agreement included scores of militants convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis, and rival lawmakers accused Odeh of supporting terror, allegations he denied. Many Palestinians view those imprisoned by Israel as freedom fighters jailed for resisting Israel's decades-long occupation of lands the Palestinians seek for a future state. Israel's Arab minority, which makes up some 20 per cent of the population, has citizenship, including the right to vote, but faces widespread discrimination. Its members have close family ties to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, and largely support their cause, leading many Jewish Israelis to view them with suspicion or contempt.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "10:00 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T10:00:00", "topics": ["Israel-Palestine", "Gaza conflict", "United Nations", "Death toll", "Fuel Crisis"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

England taking a 2-1 lead into the Test match will give them a whole lot of confidence, while Shubman Gill and co. would be looking forward to leveling the series again and taking it into the final match. England won the 3rd Test at Lord's by a small margin of 22 runs in a match that saw many twists and turns from both sides and some mind-blowing displays of batting and bowling. These Tests also have an impact on the World Test Championship standings, with India slipping to 4th spot after the recent defeat. This adds more of an incentive for teams to give it their best in order to get the better of their opponents. England vs India Potential Playing 11 Changes India As far as the visitors are concerned, the biggest question for the Manchester Test will be whether their pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah will play in the Test or not. After missing the 2nd Test due to workload management, Bumrah returned to the playing XI in the third Test and picked up 7 wickets in 2 innings, including a fifer in the 1st innings. However, with India losing the Test series if they fail to win the next Test, it is expected that Bumrah will make an appearance again. If Bumrah is not able to play, Prasidh Krishna will be the likely replacement for him in Manchester but will dampen India's hopes of coming back in the series. Arsdeep Singh is the other choice, who can use seamer friendly situation and would give provide variation with his left-arm pace bowling. With the bat, only one replacement comes to mind for now, Sai Sudharsan in place of Karun Nair. The number 3 position has been the talking point in these Tests, and Karun Nair hasn't been able to justify his place in the eleven as of now. With a dismal showing in the Lord's Test as well, he is expected to make way for Sudharsan, who hasn't got many chances so far. India Probable Playing 11 for 4th Test: Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Rishabh Pant (w), Nitish Kumar Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Akash Deep, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj England For England, their players have been giving decent returns in the series so far, with the return of Jofra Archer boosting the squad even further, as was evident in the Lord's Test. While pacer Gus Atkinson was expected to return as well, he remains in the squad for now. With no injury concerns to the Three Lions so far except a small injury to spinner Shoaib Bashir, which he came back from pretty quickly in the game, England will try to field the same eleven for the Manchester Test as well. Potential Playing 11: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (w), Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Shoaib Bashir/Gus Atkinson Key stats of Old Trafford cricket stadium, Manchester Old Trafford in Manchester has hosted 85 Test matches to date.

Sharing an update with its customers, Nvidia's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang said that the company has started filling out applications to sell the NVIDIA H20 GPU again, adding that the company hopes to resume the deliveries soon. This comes after the sale of its H20 chips was halted in April and were designed specifically to bypass the US export controls targeting China. The story so far Earlier in April, it was reported that the US President Donald Trump's administration imposed restrictions on the sale of Nvidia's H20 chips to China, tightening its control over the trade of advanced artificial intelligence technology with Beijing as part of its strategy to put pressure on China amid the tariff dispute. On April 9, Nvidia was informed that exporting the H20 chips to China would require government permission, adding that the restriction was in effect indefinitely. The restrictions were imposed citing national security concerns. The H20 chip gained attention after it was used by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that debuted a cost-effective and competitive AI model trained with the chip in January. The H20 chips are Nvidia's most advanced artificial intelligence chip that was previously available in China and became a crucial part in its booming artificial intelligence sector. The H20 chip was created to push performance limits without breaching the US export controls, which were first introduced during Joe Biden's term, a Financial Express report stated. Several Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba, Tencent, and Bytedance, were among the ones who were reportedly increasing the H20 purchases to meet the increasing demand for cost-effective artificial intelligence models. A report from RFA in April claimed that the leading Chinese tech firms, including Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance, collectively ordered over $16 billion worth of H20 chips in the first quarter, marking a rise of more than 40 per cent from the previous quarter. Ever since Trump came back to office for the second term, his administration indicated that it would deepen the tech restrictions on China. A Global Times report suggested that the idea to restrict those chips had been under consideration since Biden's term. According to a Reuters report published in May this year, Nvidia was planning to release a downgraded version of its H20 chips for China after the US export restrictions were imposed on the original model. China's response to US curbs on H20 chips China has repeatedly criticised the US' abuse of export control measures and crackdown on its tech firms. According to a Financial Times report, tech giants in China began the process of switching their development of artificial intelligence to homegrown chips. The report suggested that Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu are among those that have started to test alternative semiconductors to meet surging artificial intelligence-related internal demand and client needs. Change in US policy The development comes amid a preliminary trade deal between the US and China last month, which sought China to resume the exports of rare earth and the US to relax its export curbs, CNBC reported. The announcement of a potential policy reversal comes as Huang met with US President Donald Trump last week and policymakers in Washington. He also met with officials in Beijing as part of his efforts to boost artificial intelligence cooperation, highlighting Nvidia's support for open-source research and global AI development. In his meeting with Trump and policymakers in the US, Huang reaffirmed Nvidia's support for the Trump administration's efforts in job creation, including the US' aim to be a leader in global AI. Meanwhile, in China, it was reported that Huang met officials to discuss the benefits of artificial intelligence and ways for researchers to advance safe and secure AI for the benefit of all.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "9:51 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T09:51:00", "topics": ["Artificial intelligence", "Nvidia", "Donald Trump administration"], "author": "Swati Gandhi", "premium": "False"}

This marks the second consecutive quarter of full QVA disbursement to the majority of its workforce, even as the industry continues to battle global macroeconomic headwinds and tight client budgets. The company stated that the payout for employees in higher grades, typically managerial and leadership roles, would remain variable and aligned with the performance of their respective business units, a policy it has followed consistently across quarters. “We have paid out 100 per cent QVA to over 70 per cent of the company. For all other grades, the QVA depends on their unit’s business performance. This is in line with our standard practice across quarters,” TCS had said in a statement issued previously in May, when it also made a full QVA payout for the January-March quarter. The company’s internal grading structure begins with Y-level trainees, followed by system engineers (C1), and ascends through C2, C3, C4, C5, and executive leadership levels. Staff in the C3 and above bands generally comprise senior managers and business unit heads. Growth slows, but headcount grows Despite its commitment to employee payouts, TCS reported a mixed financial performance in Q1 FY26. Net profit rose 6 per cent year-on-year to ₹12,760 crore, up from ₹12,040 crore in the same period a year ago. However, revenue grew just 1.3 per cent year-on-year to ₹63,437 crore. In constant currency terms, revenue declined 3.1 per cent, and sequentially, revenue was down 1.6 per cent — the slowest growth since the Covid-hit Q1 FY21. The company cited global macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and sluggish discretionary tech spending as ongoing drags on demand. CEO K Krithivasan noted that a recovery in discretionary investments remained elusive. “This trend has continued and intensified to some extent in this quarter,” he said during the earnings call. Despite the subdued business environment, TCS added 5,060 employees during the April-June quarter, building on the 625 net additions made in the January-March period. The company’s workforce now stands at nearly 613,000 — the highest among Indian IT firms. Attrition for the quarter stood at 13.8 per cent. No word yet on annual increments While the firm has honoured its quarterly variable pay commitment for two straight quarters, it has yet to announce annual salary hikes. Speaking after the Q1 results, Chief Financial Officer Samir Seksaria said delivering annual wage hikes remains a top priority for the company, despite the deferment. “My priority is getting back to the wage hike,” Seksaria told PTI, though no timeline was specified. TCS typically rolls out annual increments starting in April. Seksaria noted that wage hikes, while critical, usually dent operating margins by over 150 basis points. He also pointed to a decline in utilisation levels due to upfront hiring, even as demand has remained weak. “As demand recovers, we expect utilisation to improve. If demand recovery is prolonged, we will double down on optimisation,” he said, adding that internal efficiencies will be key to margin management going forward.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "9:48 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T09:48:00", "topics": ["TCS", "Tata Consultancy Services", "Indian IT firms", "Variable pay", "increment", "hiring in IT sector", "BS Web Reports"], "author": "Vasudha Mukherjee", "premium": "False"}

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers of equities worth about ₹1,600 crore yesterday, making them net dollar buyers.\" India’s retail inflation moderated further in June to 2.1 per cent from 2.82 per cent in May, offering room for the central bank’s monetary policy committee to maintain the status quo in its upcoming reviews. The last time the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reported this mild uptick was in January 2019 -- at 1.97 per cent. The decline in food prices was mainly driven by a drop in vegetable prices and a decline in pulses. Separately, the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based factory gate inflation turned negative in June for the first time in 20 months, at -0.13 per cent as against 0.39 per cent in May. The CPI inflation came in lower, indicating a deflationary trend and offering the RBI room to consider a rate cut, although it signalled a pause in the last policy meeting, Bhansali noted. \"Meanwhile, the India-US trade deal remains under wraps, with talks ongoing in Washington. Markets await further updates on the outcome.\" On the global front, a fresh tariff threat by US President Donald Trump against Russia kept investors wary. Trump threatened 100 per cent tariffs on Russia if Vladimir Putin doesn't agree to a peace deal with Ukraine by early September. The dollar index, a measure of the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.04 per cent at 98.04. Crude oil prices remained volatile as the market digested Trump's 50-day deadline for Russia, while trade tensions with other countries linger. Brent crude price was down 0.38 per cent at $68.95 per barrel, while WTI crude prices were higher by 0.48 per cent at 66.66, as of 9:18 AM IST.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "9:27 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T09:27:00", "topics": ["Rupee", "Indian rupee", "Rupee vs dollar", "US Dollar", "currency market", "Brent crude oil", "Trump tariffs", "CPI Inflation"], "author": "SI Reporter", "premium": "False"}

The Department of Homeland Security in May said it was ending Temporary Protected Status for 11,700 people from Afghanistan in 60 days. That status had allowed them to work and meant the government could not deport them. CASA, a nonprofit immigrant advocacy group, sued the administration over the TPS revocation for Afghans as well as for people from Cameroon those expire August 4. A federal judge last Friday allowed the lawsuit to go forward but did not grant CASA's request to keep the protections in place while the lawsuit plays out. CASA appealed the case Monday and won a stay keeping in place the temporary status for Afghans that was set to expire Monday. The appeals court gave no reason for its decision, but indicated it would be deciding what to do swiftly. The stay is in place for one week, and the court has asked both sides to file briefs this week. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The number of Afghans protected by TPS is relatively small compared to the overall number of Afghans about 1,80,000 who have fled Afghanistan and come to the US since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. It's also not clear how many of those 11,7000 covered by TPS have applied for or received other forms of protection, like asylum. But the removal of the protective status for Afghans has struck a chord with many advocates and volunteers because of the suggestion that it is safe for Afghans including many who helped the US during its two-decade-long war there to go home. \"Since so many of those losing their protections served alongside US forces, we should honour that service by upholding our promise to provide safety and ensure that they have an opportunity to thrive here. We urge Congress to protect Afghans by providing them permanent status a commitment that is long overdue,\" said Jennie Murray, President and CEO of the National Immigration Forum. At the time that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ended the temporary protected status for Afghans, the department wrote in the decision that the situation in their home country was getting better. \"The Secretary determined that, overall, there are notable improvements in the security and economic situation such that requiring the return of Afghan nationals to Afghanistan does not pose a threat to their personal safety due to armed conflict or extraordinary and temporary conditions,\" according to the May announcement. Temporary Protected Status can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States. They can't be deported and can work legally but they don't have a pathway to citizenship. The status is inherently precarious because it is up to the Homeland Security secretary to renew the protections regularly usually every 18 months. The first Trump administration tried to remove many of these temporary protected statuses but was largely foiled by the courts. This time around, the Trump administration has moved even more aggressively to remove the protections, thus making more people eligible for removal from the country. The administration has pushed to remove temporary protected status from people from seven countries, with Venezuela and Haiti making up the biggest chunk of the hundreds of thousands of people losing their protections. Critics say that successive administrations essentially rubber-stamped these renewals regardless, and people covered by what's supposed to be a temporary status end up staying in the United States for years.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "9:26 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T09:26:00", "topics": ["Donald Trump", "Afghanistan", "United States"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

China's growing joint operations with Russia also pose serious security concerns to Japan, along with increasing tension around Taiwan and threats coming from North Korea, the Defence Ministry said in an annual military report submitted to Cabinet on Tuesday. \"The international society is in a new crisis era as it faces the biggest challenges since the end of World War II,\" the report said, citing significant changes to the global power balance while raising concern about an escalation of the China-US rivalry. The security threats are concentrated in the Indo-Pacific, where Japan is located, and could get worse in the future, report says. Japan has accelerated its military buildup on southwestern islands in recent years, preparing to deploy long-distance cruise missiles, as it worries about a conflict in Taiwan, which China claims as its territory to be annexed by force if necessary. Taiwan launched 10-day annual live-fire military exercises last week intended to guard against Chinese threats to invade. Japan tested a short-range, surface-to-ship missile at home earlier last month. Chinese warships' advance into the Pacific has steadily increased, with the frequency of their passage off southwestern Japan tripling in the past three years, including in waters between Taiwan and its neighbouring Japanese island of Yonaguni, the 534-page report said. The report comes days after Japan demanded China stop flying its fighter jets abnormally close to Japanese intelligence-gathering aircraft, which it said was happening repeatedly and could cause a collision. Beijing, in return, accused Japan of flying near Chinese airspace for spying purposes. Two earlier close encounters in June occurred over the Pacific Ocean, where Japan spotted two Chinese aircraft carriers operating together for the first time. China's increasing dispatch of aircraft carriers in the Pacific underscores the country's attempt to advance its sea power in distant waters, the report said. It said China's frequent dispatch of bombers for long distance flights in the Pacific by more sophisticated flight routes and fleet organization is seen as Beijing's attempt to show off its presence around Japan and to further advance its operational capability. The Defense Ministry noted two cases last year a Chinese warplane's brief violation of Japanese airspace over waters off islands near Nagasaki and an aircraft carrier's entry into a zone just outside of Japan's territorial waters further southwest in the Nansei island chain. With US President Donald Trump focusing on the strengthening of the US economy and security, Japan and other US allies face expectations to play a greater role for peace and stability in the region, the report said. North Korea poses \"an increasingly serious and imminent threat\" for Japan's security, the report said, noting the North's development of missiles carrying nuclear warheads into the Japanese territory and solid-fuel ICBM that can reach the US mainland. Russia maintains active military operations around Japan and violated the country's airspace in September, the report added, saying its increasing strategic cooperation with China has posed \"strong concern\" for Japan's security.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "9:26 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T09:26:00", "topics": ["Japan", "China", "military"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

The targeted operatives, all members of Hamas's Judea and Samaria \"headquarters,\" were involved in recruiting terrorists and coordinating attacks from Gaza into Judea and Samaria. Among those killed were Riyad Asila and Bassem Abu Sanina, who carried out the 1998 stabbing murder of Israeli civilian Haim Kerman in Jerusalem. Both were sentenced to lengthy prison terms but were released as part of the deal in which Israel freed 1,027 security prisoners in exchange for captured IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. After their exile to Gaza, the two resumed operational roles in Hamas, with Asila later joining the group's \"Jerusalem Department,\" responsible for recruiting terrorists in eastern Jerusalem. According to the Shin Bet, Asila helped direct terrorist activity from Gaza back into Israel, continuing \"to promote terrorist operations against the State of Israel.\" Another key operative eliminated in the strike was Mahmoud Saria, who was convicted of killing IDF Staff Sgt. Ehud (Udi) Tal was in a stabbing attack at the Dotan Civil Administration centre in 1996. Like the others, Saria returned to terrorist activity after his release and exile to Gaza. The Shin Bet confirmed that all seven operatives killed had been convicted of involvement in deadly attacks during the Second Intifada and were serving life sentences before their release. \"After their deportation to Gaza, they joined Hamas's West Bank Headquarters, operating in regional committees responsible for promoting attacks in Judea and Samaria, including by transferring weapons and funds to terrorists,\" the agency said. \"The terrorists who were eliminated had a long record of murderous activity and had continued operating from Gaza, using their experience and connections to support Hamas's war efforts,\" the statement added. The airstrike also reportedly killed Muhammad Adin, commander of Hamas's Daraj Tuffah battalion, in an IDF strike northeast of Gaza City. Adin was said to be accompanied by other senior commanders. His death follows the recent elimination of three other top Hamas leaders, including Muhammad Sinwar, brother of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Rafah Brigade commander Muhammad Shabana, and Hakam al-Issa, who the IDF described as one of Hamas's founding figures and its head of combat support operations.

Gross domestic product expanded 5.2 per cent in April-June from a year earlier, after a gain of 5.4 per cent in the first quarter, according to data released Tuesday by the National Bureau of Statistics. That compares with a 5.1 per cent median forecast from economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Benchmark Chinese stock indexes in Hong Kong and on the mainland pared their early gains after the data. The yuan was steady while the yield on China’s 10-year government bond was little changed. Industrial output rose 6.8 per cent in June from a year earlier, faster than the 5.6 per cent expansion forecast by economists. Retail sales increased 4.8 per cent last month, worse than economists’ projection. “It’s a picture of strong supply but weak domestic demand, and export resilience is not going to last,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA. ”Not a good set of data despite the GDP beat.” Manufacturing output surged 7.4 per cent in June from a year ago, the fastest growth in three months, driving the overall improvement in industrial production. Economists had expected retail sales growth to pull back in June after a strong gain in May, but the slump was far deeper than anticipated. In June, sales of beverages, cigarettes and alcohol as well as cosmetics all declined from a year ago, while catering services grew far slower. That dragged on overall consumption even as purchases of home appliances, communications equipment and furniture continued to soar thanks to government subsidies. Consumption contributed just over 52 per cent of economic growth in the second quarter, according to the NBS, accounting for a bigger share relative to the start of 2025 but down from more than 60 per cent a year ago. The GDP deflator — a broad measure of prices across the economy — declined for the ninth consecutive quarter, extending the longest streak since the quarterly data began in 1993. Highlights of other key economic indicators: Fixed-asset investment rose 2.8 per cent over January-June, while property investment shrank 11.2 per cent during the period The urban jobless rate was 5 per cent in June, unchanged from the previous month “The economy maintained steady growth with good momentum, showcasing strong resilience and vitality,” the NBS said in a statement. It also warned that “there are many unstable and uncertain factors” abroad while domestic demand “is insufficient.” The world’s second-largest economy has powered ahead despite a 24 per cent slump in shipments to the US in the second quarter. Overall exports still rose, while fiscal stimulus propped up domestic demand and construction. That resilience provides Beijing with breathing room to prepare a further policy response in case trade tensions with Washington flare up again when the current tariff truce ends in mid-August. Analysts polled by Bloomberg forecast GDP growth will slip to 4.6 per cent this year, significantly below the official target of around 5 per cent. What Bloomberg Economics Says... “The slowdown in GDP growth in the second quarter was relatively mild but the details raise concern about the outlook. Policymakers can’t let their guard down. Downside risks are high.” — Chang Shu and Eric Zhu The People’s Bank of China has repeatedly signaled it’s in no hurry to deploy broad-based easing, instead favoring targeted support through structural lending tools to direct credit to priority areas and avoid idle liquidity in the financial system. Government subsidies, financed by proceeds from ultra-long special sovereign bond sales, have been key to boosting household purchases of smartphones and home appliances this year, as well as corporate investment in new equipment. Central and local authorities still have more than 7 trillion yuan ($976 billion) of bonds that will be issued in the second half of the year to help support economic growth, according to an earlier state media report. Looking ahead, the Chinese economy still contends with challenges including the risk of slower exports amid uncertainties over US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Domestic demand remains fragile, weighed down by deflationary pressures stemming from excess manufacturing capacity and weak confidence as the property sector continues to contract. “Deflation remains the key threat,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “Poor retail sales and weak real estate data suggest any one-off efforts like subsidies are not a recipe for a sustainable consumption recovery.” Expectations for further support to the ailing real estate industry are rising, with speculation that a high-level government meeting is being held to address the issue. Investors also reacted positively to signals from policymakers aimed at curbing “involution,” referring to cutthroat competition among firms. Some economists expect quasi-fiscal tools to be revived to inject stimulus, while others have called for more aid to consumers should US tariffs be raised further. “It is hard to sustain the momentum,” said Woei Chen Ho, an economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. “The need for stronger policy support will re-emerge in the later part of the year when the high base and payback from strong frontloading in the first half could contribute to a sharp reversal in the growth momentum.”", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "9:16 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T09:16:00", "topics": ["China", "China economy", "China economic growth", "Chinese economy", "China exports"], "author": "Bloomberg", "premium": "False"}

Rising utilisation levels have prompted leading players to undertake aggressive capacity expansions, especially in the cables industry, as per the domestic brokerage firm. Besides, the China+1 sentiment has added to the overall bullish sentiment in the sector. \"We expect exports to be a key growth driver for Indian C&W players. Over the last 5 years, India’s C&W exports have registered a 16 per cent CAGR, and India’s share in global C&W exports has inched up,\" the brokerage firm said. However, as the industry takes on an expansion mode, new players are likely to enter the market. New entrants a threat? Despite the wires segment being largely unorganised, JM Financial believes that the entry of new players will have a minimal impact on established names. Given the strong growth outlook for the sector, there have been reports of industry giants like UltraTech and Adani (tentatively) exploring a prospective entry in the sector. A similar trend played out in the paint industry, where legacy brands felt the squeeze on their bottom lines when new players entered the market. However, the brokerage firm is not expecting a comparable outcome in the wires segment. \"We expect new entrants to have a greater impact on smaller, unorganised industry players, as compared to industry leaders,\" JM Financial said. \"Unlike in paints, entry of new entrants is unlikely to disrupt given the lower capex and a fragmented industry set up. The Indian C&W industry comprises 400+ players, ranging from SMEs to large enterprises, and we believe that the impact upon full ramp-up will be largely on smaller players, relatively insulating the large organised pack,\" the brokerage firm added. Meanwhile, a rising trend of energy consumption coupled with the ongoing urbanisation and robust expansion of data centres and electric vehicles (EVs), the future growth trajectory of the C&W sector looks promising. Plus, higher export opportunities are likely to act as a major growth driver for the industry. India's overall share in C&W exports has surged to 1.3 per cent from 0.9 per cent over the last 5-year period. That apart, the US' share in India's total C&W exports has increased from 9 per cent in the current year (CY) 2019 to 19.7 per cent in CY24. ALSO READ: How to build a smart portfolio? Dhiraj Relli of HDFC Securities suggests KEI Industries among top picks JM Financials has initiated a 'buy' rating on Polycab and KEI Industries. Notably, this coincides with a decline in both companies' stock performance so far this calendar year. Shares of Polycab India have fallen 7.6 per cent, while KEI Industries has recorded a steeper drop of 18.5 per cent per cent, during the period. However, the brokerage firm believes that the worst might be over for the companies with a strong distribution strategy in place and diversified revenue channels. JM Financials has initiated coverage on KEI Industries with a 'Buy' rating alongside a target price (TP) of ₹4,500, implying an upside of 24.6 per cent from the current market price (CMP) of ₹3,612. KEI is the second largest C&W player in the market (after Polycab) and is likely to post a revenue CAGR of 19 per cent through FY25-28E. For Polycab India, the brokerage firm is seeing an upside of 17.8 per cent from the CMP ₹6,706, citing an expected improvement in the company's fast-moving electrical goods (FMEG) segment. JM Financials has also re-initiated its coverage on RR Kabel with a 'Buy' rating. The brokerage firm has set the TP at ₹1,640 on the stock, implying an upside of 23.1 per cent from the CMP of ₹1,332.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "8:23 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T08:23:00", "topics": ["Industry Report", "JM Financial", "Markets", "Cables", "KEI Industries", "RR Kabel", "Polycab India"], "author": "Harshita Dudeja", "premium": "False"}

Trump made these remarks during a meeting with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House, Bloomberg reported. He added, \"We’re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100%\". Without providing details, Trump said that the levies on Russia would come in the form of \"secondary tariffs\", a term which he has used in the past to describe duties imposed on nations for trading with American adversaries. Trump hardens stance on Russia Donald Trump has hardened his stance on Russia as Moscow's conflict with Kyiv entered its fourth year earlier in February. Since then, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine, resulting in casualties. On July 9, Russia launched a deadly drone strike and missile attack on Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv, despite several warnings by Trump. Trump has also expressed his disappointment with Putin, as a peace deal with Ukraine has stalled. Before taking office in January 2025, the US President vowed to end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours. Peace talks were resumed between the two countries twice this year- first in Istanbul in mid-May and then in early June, but a third round is yet to be scheduled. Trump approves sending Patriot missiles to Ukraine Trump's hardened stance on Russia comes days after the US government agreed to resume deliveries of weapons to Ukraine after pausing them. Earlier on Monday, Trump announced that the US will be sending Patriot air defence missiles to Ukraine to defend itself. In a major policy shift, Trump noted that the deliveries of missiles are crucial for Ukraine because Russian President Vladimir Putin \"talks nice but then he bombs everybody in the evening\", Reuters reported. Trump to levy tariffs on Russia Trump did not clarify on the powers he would use to impose secondary tariffs; he, however, added that he was not sure if they needed the US Congress to act in order to move forward, adding that the legislation \"could be very useful.\" His tariffs echo the punishment mentioned in a bipartisan bill in Congress that would impose 500 per cent tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil and gas. Trump hailed the announcement made Monday as he tries to push Putin to end the hostilities. He added, “I’m disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn’t seem to get there.\" The recent shift in Trump's remarks shows how his willingness to deal with the Russian President is being tested. The recent change in his remarks also marks a departure from much of the ire he directed at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the first few months of his term.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "8:11 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T08:11:00", "topics": ["Donald Trump", "Vladimir Putin", "US Russia", "Russia Ukraine Conflict", "BS Web Reports", "US sanctions", "Zelenskyy"], "author": "Swati Gandhi", "premium": "False"}

The ministers met Monday in Brussels following Trump's surprise announcement over the weekend of such hefty tariffs, which could have repercussions for governments, companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU is America's biggest business partner and the world's largest trading bloc. Maro efcovic, the EU's trade representative in its talks with the US, said after the meeting that it was \"very obvious from the discussions today, the 30 per cent is absolutely unacceptable\". He said that the commission was sharing proposals with the 27 member countries \"for the second list of goods accounting of some 72 billion euros ($84 billion) worth of US imports. They will now have a chance to discuss it. This does not exhaust our toolbox and every instrument remains on the table\". Lars Lkke Rasmussen, foreign minister of Denmark, which recently assumed the presidency of the EU, said the ministers vowed to work together in negotiating a trade deal with Washington or agreeing on countermeasures. \"The EU remains ready to react and that includes robust and proportionate countermeasures if required and there was a strong, feeling in the room of unity,\" Rasmussen told reporters after the meeting. The tariffs, also announced for Mexico, are set to start on August 1 and could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the US, and destabilise economies from Portugal to Norway. Meanwhile, Brussels decided to suspend retaliatory tariffs on US goods scheduled to take effect Monday in hopes of reaching a trade deal with the Trump administration by the end of the month. The \"countermeasures\" by the EU, which negotiates trade deals on behalf of its 27 member countries, will be delayed until August 1. Trump's letter shows \"that we have until the first of August\" to negotiate, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday. Maro efcovic, the EU's trade representative in its talks with the US, said negotiations would continue Monday. \"I'm absolutely 100 per cent sure that a negotiated solution is much better than the tension which we might have after the 1st of August,\" he told reporters in Brussels on Monday. But he added that \"we must be prepared for all outcomes\". \"I cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort. Having said that, the current uncertainty caused by unjustified tariffs cannot persist indefinitely and therefore we must prepare for all outcomes, including, if necessary, well-considered proportionate countermeasures to restore the balance in our transit static relationship.\" The letters to the EU and Mexico come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade. Trump imposed tariffs in April on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, he began sending tariff letters to leaders, but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks. If he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy. The American Chamber of Commerce in the European Union, an influential industry group representing major American corporations in Europe, said the tariffs could \"generate damaging ripple effects across all sectors of the EU and US economies\" and praised the EU's delay of countermeasures. In the wake of the new tariffs, European leaders largely closed ranks, calling for unity but also a steady hand to not provoke further acrimony. Just last week, Europe was cautiously optimistic. Officials told reporters on Friday they weren't expecting a letter like the one sent Saturday and that a trade deal was to be inked in \"the coming days\". For months, the EU has broadcast that it has strong retaliatory measures ready if talks fail. Reeling from successive rebukes from Washington, efcovic said Monday the EU is \"doubling down on efforts to open new markets\" and pointed to a new economic agreement with Indonesia as one. The EU top brass will visit Beijing fora summit later this month while courting other Pacific nations like South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia, whose prime minister visited Brussels over the weekend to sign a new economic partnership with the EU. It also has mega-deals in the works with Mexico and a trading bloc of South American nations known as Mercosur, and efcovic will meet with his counterpart from the United Arab Emirates next week. While meeting with Indonesia's president on Sunday, Von der Leyen said that \"when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together\".", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "7:50 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T07:50:00", "topics": ["Donald Trump", "US-EU trade deal", "European Union", "Trump tariffs"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

Among these, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Margin Trading Facility (MTF) are emerging as powerful tools that, when combined, offer a smarter, more flexible approach to portfolio construction. This synergy enables investors to navigate today’s dynamic markets with efficiency, agility, and strategic precision. Over the past five years, ETFs have transitioned from niche investment products to mainstream constituents of Indian portfolios. According to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), as of June 2025, assets under management (AUM) in ETFs have soared to approximately Rs. 9.24 trillion, a fourfold increase from approximately Rs. 1.86 trillion in June 2020. This meteoric rise reflects a confluence of factors: the allure of low-cost passive investing, transparency, liquidity, and an increasing awareness of diversification benefits among retail and institutional investors alike. Equity ETFs dominate the segment, with assets exceeding Rs. 7.4 trillion, capturing investor confidence in India’s economic growth story. Debt ETFs have accumulated around Rs. 97,000 crore, appealing to risk-averse investors seeking stability. Gold ETFs, serving as a safe haven amid global uncertainties, have crossed Rs. 64,000 crore in AUM. The expansion of thematic and smart beta ETFs—strategies that deviate from traditional market-cap weighting—has further enriched the investment landscape, catering to investors seeking tailored exposure aligned with specific themes or factors. Retail participation has also seen robust growth, with retail AUM having tripled between March 2020 and March 2025, growing from Rs. 5,335 crore to over Rs. 17,800 crore, driven by digital platforms providing seamless access to a broad spectrum of ETF products. Institutional investors have ramped up their ETF holdings as well, and this institutional endorsement underscores ETFs’ credibility as a strategic component of long-term asset allocation. ALSO READ: Top stock picks for today, July 15: NTPC Green, Hindustan Unilever and more Amplifying returns with Margin Trading Facility (MTF) While ETFs provide a cost-effective and transparent avenue for diversification, MTF introduces an additional layer of strategic flexibility. By allowing investors to borrow funds to purchase securities, including ETFs, MTF enables leveraged investing. When used prudently, this approach can magnify gains, provided risk management principles are rigorously adhered to. The combination of ETFs and MTF is particularly compelling because it facilitates broad market exposure with leverage, reducing the concentration risk associated with individual stocks. For example, an optimistic investor with a positive outlook on India’s growth trajectory might choose to buy units of a Nifty 50 ETF using MTF. This strategy offers instant diversification across 50 of India’s leading companies and amplifies market exposure without requiring additional capital upfront. The liquidity and real-time pricing of ETFs ensure that positions can be adjusted swiftly in response to market movements, while daily mark-to-market settlements provide transparency and control over leverage-related risks. Data-driven growth The momentum behind ETFs and MTF is evident. The share of ETFs within total mutual fund AUM has nearly doubled since 2020, now accounting for approximately 12.4 per cent of total mutual fund AUM. Industry forecasts project strong growth over the next several years, driven by regulatory support, fintech innovations, and rising investor education. Smart beta and thematic ETFs are poised to become even more prominent as investors seek strategies aligned with specific risk profiles, ESG considerations, or thematic preferences. Advances in digital infrastructure will continue to democratize access to sophisticated tools like MTF, allowing both retail and high-net-worth investors to build more nuanced, resilient portfolios. Building smarter portfolios To leverage the combined potential of ETFs and MTF effectively, investors must adopt a disciplined and strategic approach. It begins with aligning leverage strategies with individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial objectives. Selecting ETFs with high liquidity and low tracking error is essential to ensure efficient execution and minimised deviation from benchmark indices. Moreover, understanding the interest costs associated with MTF is crucial, as these can impact net returns, especially over longer holding periods. The integration of ETFs and MTF offers a compelling proposition: the ability to construct diversified, cost-efficient portfolios that are adaptable to market conditions. This approach not only enhances growth prospects but also fosters prudent risk management, enabling investors to navigate volatility with confidence. ============= Dhiraj Relli is MD & CEO, HDFC Securities.

While the pace of large deal signings remained subdued, the quarter avoided widespread project deferrals or ramp-downs, pointing to operational resilience. Growth trends across the sector continue to diverge. While Tier-I companies are likely to post flat to marginal constant currency (cc) revenue movement, mid-tier firms are expected to outperform, supported by healthy deal ramp-ups, strong vertical traction, and recent acquisitions. Reported INR revenue will also benefit from 100–200 basis points of cross-currency gains, thanks to the weak US dollar. The pace of deal signings in Q2FY26 and beyond remains a key monitorable. Although discretionary IT budgets remain under pressure, client interest in next-generation, AI-led productivity programs is steadily gaining ground. As these initiatives transition from pilots to scaled execution, they could drive deal momentum in the coming quarters. Operating margins are expected to remain range-bound. Supply-side pressures have largely normalised, but factors such as visa costs, rupee appreciation, and modest revenue growth are likely to cap margin expansion. Nevertheless, some firms could benefit from better utilisation, pyramid optimisation, and the absence of earlier one-offs. The near-term setup is supported by seasonal strength in the first half, a stable demand environment in key verticals, and improving deal conversion for select players. While valuations are not materially discounted, they leave room for positive re-rating in case of earnings surprises. Key variables to track include visibility on large transformation programs, client commentary around tech budgets, deal pipeline progression, and execution in emerging tech areas like GenAI, automation, and cloud services. While a broad-based acceleration is yet to materialise, the sector appears to be transitioning toward a more stable footing. With early signs of demand revival and a favourable base in the second half, the groundwork is being laid for a more constructive FY26. Track Stock Market LIVE Updates HCL Tech – Target Price: ₹2,000 HCLT is well-positioned for FY26, supported by strong deal wins (USD 3 billion, +43 per cent QoQ) and revenue growth guidance of 2–5 per cent YoY CC, above peers. Margins held steady at 18 per cent, with management maintaining its FY26 target of 18–19 per cent. ER&D and Services continue to outperform, and early signs of recovery are visible in the manufacturing vertical. Deal momentum is underpinned by GenAI-led cost optimisation, and attrition has eased with ongoing fresher hiring. While discretionary spending remains muted, HCLT’s diversified portfolio, strong pipeline, and muted supply-side pressures provide margin stability. We expect USD revenue and INR PAT to grow at a CAGR of 5.9 per cent and 8.2 per cent, respectively, over FY25–27E. Coforge – Target price: ₹2,400 We reiterate our 'Buy' on Coforge, supported by a robust executable order book of USD 1.5 billion (+47 per cent YoY) and strong traction in BFSI and transportation, both growing over 20 per cent YoY in FY25. The company is on track to achieve its USD 2 billion revenue target by FY27, aided by organic growth, Cigniti-led cross-sell, and the landmark USD 1.6 billion Sabre deal. Cross-currency gains and broad-based client momentum across BFSI and Insurance (48.5 per cent of revenue) further enhance visibility. Margins are set to expand, with one-offs behind and tailwinds from delivery mix and lower ESOP costs; management is targeting an 18 per cent Ebitda margin by FY27.

Nine countries accounted for more than half of those unprotected children. In their annual estimate of global vaccine coverage, released Tuesday, the World Health Organization and UNICEF said about 89 per cent of children under one year old got a first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough vaccine in 2024, the same as in 2023. About 85 per cent completed the three-dose series, up from 84 per cent in 2023. Officials acknowledged, however, that the collapse of international aid this year will make it more difficult to reduce the number of unprotected children. In January, US President Trump withdrew the country from the WHO, froze nearly all humanitarian aid and later moved to close the US AID Agency. And last month, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said it was pulling the billions of dollars the US had previously pledged to the vaccines alliance Gavi, saying the group had \"ignored the science\". Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, has previously raised questions the diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough vaccine which has proven to be safe and effective after years of study and real-world use. Vaccines prevent 3.5 million to 5 million deaths a year, according to UN estimates. \"Drastic cuts in aid, coupled with misinformation about the safety of vaccines, threaten to unwind decades of progress,\" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. UN experts said that access to vaccines remained \"deeply unequal\" and that conflict and humanitarian crises quickly unraveled progress; Sudan had the lowest reported coverage against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough. The data showed that nine countries accounted for 52 per cent of all children who missed out on immunisations entirely: Nigeria, India, Sudan, Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Angola. WHO and UNICEF said that coverage against measles rose slightly, with 76 per cent of children worldwide receiving both vaccine doses. But experts say measles vaccine rates need to reach 95 per cent to prevent outbreaks of the extremely contagious disease. WHO noted that 60 countries reported big measles outbreaks last year. The US is now having its worst measles outbreak in more than three decades, while the disease has also surged across Europe, with 1,25,000 cases in 2024 twice as many as the previous year, according to WHO. Last week, British authorities reported a child died of measles in a Liverpool hospital. Health officials said that despite years of efforts to raise awareness, only about 84 per cent of children in the UK are protected. \"It is hugely concerning, but not at all surprising, that we are continuing to see outbreaks of measles,\" said Helen Bradford, a professor of children's health at University College London. \"The only way to stop measles spreading is with vaccination,\" she said in a statement. \"It is never too late to be vaccinated even as an adult.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "7:24 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T07:24:00", "topics": ["Vaccine", "United Nations", "World Health Organisation", "Vaccination"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

Proponents said the import tax will help rebuild the shrinking US tomato industry and ensure that produce eaten in the US is also grown there. Mexico currently supplies around 70 per ccent of the US tomato market, up from 30 per cent two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. But opponents, including US companies that grow tomatoes in Mexico, said the tariff will make fresh tomatoes more expensive for US buyers. Tim Richards, a professor at the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University, said US retail prices for tomatoes will likely rise around 8.5 per cent with a 17 per cent duty. The duty stems from a longstanding US complaint about Mexico's tomato exports and is separate from the 30 per cent base tariff on products made in Mexico and the European Union that President Donald Trump announced on Saturday. The Commerce Department said in late April that it was withdrawing from a deal it first reached with Mexico in 2019 to settle allegations the country was exporting tomatoes to the US at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping. As part of the deal, Mexico had to sell its tomatoes at a minimum price and abide by other rules. Since then, the agreement has been subject to periodic reviews, but the two sides always reached an agreement that avoided duties. In announcing its withdrawal from the Tomato Suspension Agreement, the Commerce Department said it had been \"flooded with comments\" from US tomato growers who wanted better protection from Mexican goods. But others, including the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Restaurant Association, had called on the Commerce Department to reach an agreement with Mexico. In a letter sent last week to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the Chamber of Commerce and 30 other business groups said US companies employ 50,000 workers and generate $8.3 billion in economic benefits moving tomatoes from Mexico into communities across the country. \"We are concerned that withdrawing from the agreement at a time when the business community is already navigating significant trade uncertainty could lead to retaliatory actions by our trading partners against other commodities and crops that could create further hardship for US businesses and consumers,\" the letter said.", "date": "Jul 15 2025", "time": "7:12 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-15T07:12:00", "topics": ["tomato", "Tomatoes", "US mexico", "Mexico", "Import duty", "Import duty hike", "Donald Trump administration"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

A hesitant drizzle tapping gently on windowpanes, the scent of damp earth rushing through the air, the sky unsure whether to break open or pull back. You pause. Look up. And somehow, instinctively, you know: the season is changing. The first signs of transformation rarely arrive with fanfare. They slip into our routines, barely noticed, easily dismissed, yet carry the weight of larger shifts. Similarly, across India’s boardrooms, legislative halls, and corridors of power, we see such signs: tentative, scattered, but unmistakably signalling that something deeper is afoot. Let’s dive in. In Delhi, the government seems ready to admit that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code needs more than minor tweaks. As our first editorial outlines, the Parliamentary Standing Committee has recommended exclusive NCLT and NCLAT benches to unclog IBC’s resolution process, where cases drag nearly twice the permitted limit. The hope? With amendments expected in the Monsoon Session, this might just be the breeze before the downpour. In Bengal, too, the air is thick with irony and anticipation. Mamata Banerjee, once the fiercest critic of Tata’s industrial push in Singur, is now seeking their investment ahead of state elections. But as our second editorial shows, a single meeting with N Chandrasekaran won’t undo years of investor scepticism. Wooing investors is only half the job. Bengal must also tackle its deep-rooted anti-industry perceptions if it wants more than token showers of investment. Meanwhile, Akash Prakash raises a thunderous question: Why are Indian entrepreneurs afraid to take long-term risks? Our obsession with margins and capital efficiency, he argues, is holding us back from global dominance. Unlike China or the US, our ecosystem still chases safe returns, not disruptive scale. A cultural shift in capital allocation might be India Inc’s most urgent stormcloud. Yet, opportunity beckons. Rajeswari Sengupta writes that a rare trade window has opened: the US-China tariff war offers India a low-barrier shot at becoming a global manufacturing hub. But unless we act fast to fix domestic bottlenecks, this chance may evaporate like steam off hot asphalt. And finally, Sanjeev Ahluwalia reviews The Stoic Capitalist: Advice for the exceptionally ambitious by Robert Rosenkranz, a book urging readers to embrace discomfort, act with reason, and think generationally.

Aiden Cazares is one of 1.4 million children and teenagers around the country who have been attending after-school and summer programming at a Boys & Girls Club, the YMCA or a public school for free thanks to federal taxpayers. Congress set aside money for the programmes to provide academic support, enrichment and child care to mostly low-income families, but President Donald Trump's administration recently froze the funding. The money for the 21st Century Community Learning Centres is among more than $6 billion in federal education grants Trump's Republican administration has withheld, saying it wants to ensure recipients' programs align with the president's priorities. After-school programmes for the fall are in jeopardy In Rhode Island, the state stepped in with funding to keep the summer programs running, according to the Boys & Girls Club of East Providence. Other Boys & Girls Clubs supported by the grants have found ways to keep open their summer programs, said Sara Leutzinger, vice president for communications for the Boys & Girls Club of America. But there isn't the same hope for the after-school programming for the fall. Some of the 926 Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide that run 21st Century Community Learning summer and after-school programs stand to close if the Trump administration doesn't release the money in the next three to five weeks, Leutzinger said. The YMCA and Save the Children say many of the centres they run are also at risk of shuttering. Time is of the essence, said Christy Gleason, executive director of Save the Children Action Network, which provides after-school programming for 41 schools in rural areas in Washington state and across the South, where school will begin as soon as August. It's not too late to make a decision so the kids who really need this still have it. Schools in Republican-led areas are particularly affected by the freeze in federal education grants. Ninety-one of the 100 school districts that receive the most money from four frozen grant programs are in Republican congressional districts, according to an analysis from New America, a left-leaning think tank. Of those top 100 school districts, half are in four states: California, West Virginia, Florida and Georgia. New America's analysis used funding levels reported in 2022 in 46 states. Republican officials have been among the educators criticizing the grant freeze. I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,\" said Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, an elected Republican. In Georgia, we're getting ready to start the school year, so I call on federal funds to be released so we can ensure the success of our students. The Office of Management and Budget said some grants supported left-wing causes, pointing to services for immigrants in the country illegally or LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts. Summer clubs provide instruction for children At the East Providence summer camp, Aiden, a rising third grader, played tag, built structures with magnetic tiles, played a fast-paced game with the other kids to review addition and subtraction, learned about pollination, watched a nature video and ate club-provided chicken nuggets. Veteran teachers from his school corrected him when he spoke without raising his hand and offered common-sense advice when a boy in his group said something inappropriate. When someone says something inappropriate, you don't repeat it, teacher Kayla Creighton told the boys between answering their questions about horseflies and honeybees. Indeed, it's hard to find a more middle-of-the road organization in this country than the Boys & Girls Club. Just last month, a Republican and a Democrat sponsored a resolution in the US House celebrating the 165-year-old organization as a beacon of hope and opportunity. The Defence Department awarded the club $3 million in 1991 to support children left behind when their parents deployed for the Persian Gulf. And ever since, the Boys & Girls Club has created clubs on military installations to support the children of service members. Military families can sign up their kids for free. I suspect they will realize that most of those grants are fine and will release them, said Mike Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education policy think tank, speaking of the Trump administration's review of the 21st Century Community Learning Centre grants. But not everyone is so sure. Families see few affordable child care alternatives Aiden's mother has started looking into afternoon child care for September when kids return to school in Rhode Island. It costs $220 a week, Reyes said, her eyes expanding. I can't afford that. The single mother and state worker said she'll probably ask her 14-year-old son to stay home and watch Aiden. That will mean he would have to forgo getting a job when he turns 15 in the fall and couldn't play basketball and football. I don't have any other option, she said. At home, Aiden would likely stay inside on a screen. That would be heartbreaking since he's thrived getting tutoring and learning about healthy boundaries from the Boys & Girls Club programme, Reyes said. Fernande Berard learned about the funding freeze and possible closure from a reporter after dropping off her three young boys for summer camp. I would be really devastated if this goes away, said the nurse. I honestly don't know what I would do. Her husband drives an Uber much of the day, and picking up the kids early would eat into his earnings. It's money they need to pay the mortgage and everything else. If her boss approves, she'd likely have to pick up her children from school and take them to the rehabilitation centre where she oversees a team of nurses. The children would have to stay until her work day ends.

His remarks came on the same day Niti Aayog released the third edition of its ‘Trade Watch Quarterly’ report, indicating that India is expected to gain competitiveness in 22 of the top 30 product categories (at the HS 2 level) under the current US tariff regime. These categories account for 61 per cent (representing a market size of $49.3 billion) of India’s exports to the US and 68 per cent ($2,285.2 billion) of total US imports. This competitiveness offers Indian exporters an opportunity to strengthen their presence in the US market, particularly when its global peers face steeper tariff barriers. The Niti Aayog’s assessment assumes that India will face an extra 10 per cent tariff, while many other countries, like China, Mexico, and Canada will face higher tariffs ranging from 20 to 50 per cent. This would enhance India’s market potential in nuclear reactors, iron and steel, textiles, electricals, and vehicles. At the HS 4 level, India enjoys a favourable tariff differential in 78 of the top 100 products, which together account for about 52 per cent (representing a market size of $42 billion) of its exports to the US. These findings highlight India’s growing export potential to the world’s largest consumer economy, mentions the Niti Aayog report. While six of the top 30 (at HS 2 level) product categories maintained status quo on tariff, India’s competitiveness remains unchanged. This segments account for 32.8 per cent of its exports to the US worth $26.5 billion, highlighting the scale of opportunity available for Indian exporters. The modest differences open avenues for targeted trade negotiations with the US. India’s tariff advantage over China is notable, the report mentions. The average tariff differential stands at 20.5 per cent in India’s favour, enhancing its potential to expand market share at China’s expense. Among the top 10 product categories, leading exporters to the US in the HS 2 product categories like China, Canada, and Mexico, face tariffs higher than India’s by an average of 19.6 per cent. Further, the analysis of the HS 4 level shows that in around 80 of the top 100 products, competitors face higher tariffs than India, reinforcing its export momentum. These products make up a large share of India’s exports to the US and of what the US imports, offering India the opportunity to expand its market. Even in categories where India faces higher duties, the tariff differential is typically under 1 per cent, affecting products that make up 24.5 per cent of India’s US-bound exports. This narrow differential reduces India’s competitive disadvantage, especially as countries like China continue to face escalating trade barriers. As global supply chains realign and trade relationships evolve, India’s comparatively lower tariff burden positions it favourably to capitalise on emerging trade corridors, particularly with the United States. The report recommended that India should focus on important service sectors like financial services and IT while negotiating a trade deal with the US. Understanding Harmonised System Under Indian Trade Clarification based on the Harmonized System, HS 2 and HS 4 products refer to the first two and four digits of the Harmonized System (HS) code, respectively. The HS code is a standardised system used to classify traded products, and it’s crucial for customs and trade purposes. The product labels under HS 2 category includes electrical machinery, nuclear reactors, mineral oils and products, articles of iron or steel, articles of textile and accessories, fish & crustaceans, plastic & articles thereof, etc. The product labels under HS 4 category includes telephone sets, including smartphones, semiconductor devices, turbojets, petroleum oils, tube and pipe fittings, bed, kitchen and toilet linen, jewellery, etc.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "11:58 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T23:58:00", "topics": ["Piyush Goyal", "US India relations", "Niti Aayog", "US tariffs", "financial services"], "author": "Rajarshi Bhattacharjee", "premium": "False"}

The last time the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reported this mild uptick was in January 2019 — at 1.97 per cent, data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Monday showed. Separately, the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based factory gate inflation turned negative in June for the first time in 20 months, at -0.13 per cent as against 0.39 per cent in May, data by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on Monday showed. The last time the WPI reported deflation was in October 2023, at -0.26 per cent. In retail inflation, the decline in food prices was mainly driven by a 19 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) drop in vegetable prices — the sharpest pace of decline since December 2022 — and an 11.8 per cent (Y-o-Y) decline in pulses — the fastest fall in prices in over seven years. Spices and meat, which together have a 7.5 per cent weight in the CPI, also saw prices drop 3.03 per cent and 1.62 per cent, respectively. Besides, the pace of price rise for other items in the food basket, including cereals (3.73 per cent) and sugar (3.5 per cent), decelerated during May. Though the price rise for edible oils (17.7 per cent) and fruit (12.6 per cent) also slowed, it remained in double digits during the month. Rajani Sinha, chief economist at CareEdge Ratings, says that the good progress of the monsoon, adequate reservoir levels, and strong kharif sowing bode well for agricultural output and food price stability, and that close monitoring of the monsoon’s spatial and temporal distribution remains crucial. “The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already front-loaded the rate cuts anticipating moderation in inflation; hence, we do not expect further rate cuts unless economic growth weakens materially,” she added. Core inflation — which excludes volatile food and fuel components — edged up to 4.4 per cent in June, the highest since September 2023, on the back of a surge in gold prices and a steady increase in demand in the economy. Paras Jasrai, associate director at India Ratings & Research, says the rising core inflation might look concerning prima facie, but it was due to a sharp increase in prices of jewellery items, as gold prices rose to a 58-month high of 36 per cent due to tensions in West Asia. “Services inflation inched up to a 22-month high of 4.1 per cent, indicative of steady demand in the services sector. However, over two-thirds of the items still have inflation of less than 4 per cent, pointing to a broader disinflationary profile of consumption items,” he said. The RBI may maintain a status quo in the upcoming review in view of the cumulative easing of 100 basis points done so far in 2025 and the change in stance to neutral from accommodative,” he added. Fuel prices decelerated to 2.78 per cent, while inflation in services like personal care (14.7 per cent), health (4.43 per cent), and transport (3.9 per cent) picked up pace in June. The NSO data further showed that retail prices rose 1.72 per cent in rural India and 2.56 per cent in urban areas. Among 22 major states and Union Territories (UTs) with a population of more than 5 million for which data is available, 10 states/UTs recorded an inflation rate higher than the national average. Kerala recorded the highest retail inflation of 6.71 per cent in June, while Telangana recorded deflation (-0.93 per cent). In the WPI, the deflation was led by a decline in the prices of primary food articles (-3.75 per cent), which fell for the third month in a row. This was driven by a decline in the prices of vegetables (-22.65 per cent), pulses (-14.1 per cent), potatoes (-32.7 per cent), onions (-33.5 per cent), and protein-rich food items like eggs, meat, and fish (-0.29 per cent). Meanwhile, the prices of factory-gate manufactured products decelerated to 1.97 per cent in June. This was led by a slowdown in prices of manufactured food products (6.99 per cent), paper products (1.52 per cent), chemicals (0.59 per cent), and rubber (0.47 per cent), among others. Prices of basic metals (3.14 per cent) and semi-finished steel (3.7 per cent) also dipped during the month. Fuel and power prices declined by 2.65 per cent in June, as the deceleration in global commodity prices — especially mineral oils — led to a fall in the prices of petrol (-6.57 per cent) and high-speed diesel (-5.12 per cent) for the 13th and 26th straight month, respectively. Cooking gas prices, however, rose by 2.68 per cent during June. “The seasonal sequential uptick in food prices has been relatively modest in July 2025 so far. Besides, international crude oil prices have also eased somewhat in the ongoing month from the peak seen in June 2025, amid cooling tensions in West Asia, while remaining in deflationary territory. Overall, Icra expects the headline WPI to remain in deflationary territory in July 2025 despite an unfavourable base,” said Icra Ratings Chief Economist Aditi Nayar.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "11:57 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T23:57:00", "topics": ["WPI inflation", "retail inflation", "monetary policy committee", "MPC meet", "Consumer Price Index"], "author": "Shiva Rajora", "premium": "False"}

The company reported a consolidated loss of ₹428 crore, widening 23 per cent from ₹347 crore in the same period a year earlier. Revenue from operations slumped nearly 50 per cent to ₹828 crore, down from ₹1,644 crore a year ago. The steep decline in sales was partially offset by cost-cutting measures, with total expenses falling 42 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to ₹1,065 crore. The results highlight the challenges facing India’s electric vehicle sector as it grapples with softening demand and heightened competition, even as firms push to scale production and capture market share. Ola’s market share is slipping amid rising competition from incumbents like Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company. While losses widened Y-o-Y, the company’s net loss declined by more than 50 per cent on a quarterly basis. During the quarter under review, the company also reported a positive earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda). “The company’s automotive (auto) business turned Ebitda-positive in June, on the back of strong gross margins owing to the company’s vertical integration strategy,” it said in a statement. Ola Electric delivered a total of 68,192 vehicles in Q1FY26, up from 51,375 units in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024–25 (FY25), marking an increase of 32.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter. The auto segment Ebitda improved sharply to 11.6 per cent, compared to -90.6 per cent in the fourth quarter (Q4) of FY25, with June marking the first Ebitda-positive month for the auto business. Consolidated Ebitda also saw a substantial recovery to -28.6 per cent from the previous quarter. The company’s cost-optimisation initiative, Project Lakshya, has driven major operating efficiencies, reducing monthly auto operational expenditure (opex) from ₹178 crore to ₹105 crore. Consolidated opex now stands at ₹150 crore per month, with a further reduction to ₹130 crore per month targeted through FY26. Operating cash flow for the auto business was nearly neutral in Q1, and free cash flow improved to -₹107 crore — a marked improvement from -₹455 crore in Q4. Ola Electric’s product road map continues to show strong customer traction. The newly introduced Gen 3 scooters accounted for 80 per cent of total scooter sales during the quarter. These scooters have not only delivered better margins but have also sharply reduced warranty claims, reflecting the company’s ongoing engineering improvements. Meanwhile, the rollout of Ola Electric’s Roadster X motorcycles is progressing in phases, with the product now available in 200 stores across India and set to scale further during the upcoming festival season. On the software front, MoveOS+ adoption surged to nearly 50 per cent among new customers, up from 2 per cent in Q4. One of Ola Electric’s most significant technological advancements is the in-house production of its 4680 Bharat Cell, which will begin powering vehicles starting this Navratri. The company expects that by the end of FY26, it will fully utilise the 1.4 gigawatt-hour (GWh) capacity and install the remaining capacity to reach 5 GWh, scaling consumption to that level through 2026–27. The company has also successfully developed Heavy Rare Earths-free motors, scheduled for production deployment in the third quarter of FY26. These initiatives, enabled by the company’s deep investment in vertical integration and research and development, are aimed at reducing costs and enhancing performance. For FY26, the company expects to sell between 325,000 and 375,000 vehicles and generate revenue of ₹4,200–4,700 crore. With production-linked incentive benefits kicking in from the second quarter (Q2) for the Gen 3 product portfolio, gross margin is projected to rise to 35–40 per cent, and the company anticipates full-year auto Ebitda of over 5 per cent. It also expects the auto business to remain Ebitda-positive from Q2 onwards.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "11:51 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T23:51:00", "topics": ["Ola Electric Mobility", "Q1 results", "corporate earnings"], "author": "Peerzada Abrar", "premium": "False"}

The poll authority said with 11 more days left for the last date of submission of the filled enumeration forms (EFs) in the ongoing Bihar SIR, EFs of 6,60,67,208 or 83.66 per cent of the 7,89,69,844 electors in Bihar have been collected after two rounds of door-to-door visits by booth-level officers (BLOs).

Only 11.82 per cent of electors now remain to submit their filled EFs and many of them have sought time to submit their forms with documents in the coming days,\" the commission said. It said for the electors who may have temporarily migrated out of the state, focused efforts through newspaper advertisements and direct contact with such persons are being made to ensure that they are able to fill their EFs well in time and have their names also included in the draft roll to be published on August 1. Such electors can easily fill up EFs online using their mobile phones through the ECINet App or the online system. They can also send their forms to the concerned BLOs through their family members or any online means, including WhatsApp or similar applications. In the fourth phase of intensive revision in Bihar, the draft electoral roll will be published on August 1. The list will include all electors whose forms have been received by the deadline.

A new Consulate General is opening in Yekaterinburg, which will deal with these issues,\" Andrey Besedin, the head of the Ural Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told the RosBusinessConsulting (RBC) news agency. Besedin said the migration of Indians would fill the shortage of a highly qualified workforce in the Sverdlovsk region. Sverdlovsk, with the capital Yekaterinburg, is situated in the Ural mountains and is home to Russian heavy industry and military-industrial complex, including world-famous Uralmash and T-90 series tank maker Ural Wagon Zavod. Besedin stressed that industrial enterprises needed to increase production volumes, but the region faced a shortage of skilled workers. Some workers are deployed in the military operation in Ukraine, and young people do not go to factories, Besedin said. He said Russia was also considering inviting labourers from Sri Lanka and North Korea, but it was a rather complex issue. Migrant workers from India began to arrive at enterprises in Russian regions in 2024. They were in particular invited by the Kaliningrad fish processing complex \"Za Rodinu\" against the backdrop of a labour shortage. According to the RBC news agency, the Russian Ministry of Labour predicted a workforce shortage of 3.1 million people by 2030. It proposed an increase in the quota for inviting qualified foreign workers in 2025 by 1.5 times to 0.23 million people. According to the ministry's estimate, Russian industrial enterprises attracted 47 thousand qualified migrants from non-CIS countries in 2024. The Ministry of Economic Development also called for expanding the geography of attracting workers from other countries. However, Russian authorities tightened migration legislation to curb the influx of migrants from the former Soviet republics after the terrorist attack at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow on March 22 last year.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "11:49 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T23:49:00", "topics": ["Russia", "India", "workforce", "Indian workforce"], "author": "Press Trust of India", "premium": "False"}

On a sequential basis profit was down 10.7 per cent. It reported 3.7 per cent constant-currency revenue growth for the April-June quarter, helped by its technology and services, telecommunications and media, and financial services. These more than offset the sluggishness in manufacturing and the life-sciences vertical. For the quarter ended June 30, HCL reported revenue of ₹30,349 crore, up 8.2 per cent over that in the same period a year earlier. The value of the new deal bookings stood at $1.81 billion. That also helped India’s third-largest IT services exporter to raise the lower end of its guidance. HCL now expects to grow 3-5 per cent on a constant-currency basis for the full year, up from 2-5 per cent it had projected in April. However, the firm cut its EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin guidance to 17-18 per cent from 18-19 per cent earlier. The company said the margins would be impacted due to restructuring. “The macro environment remained stable from an overall perspective, with some variations across verticals, but the overall situation did not deteriorate as feared at the start of the quarter,” said C Vijayakumar, chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director, at a news conference. “We won a large consolidation deal in financial services this quarter, which is not accounted for in the total contract value (TCV) for the first quarter,” Vijayakumar added. “We have some large deals in the pipeline which were expected to close in Q1 but have moved to the second quarter. This delay is unrelated to the external or macro factors. We are optimistic about this conversion, and if all goes according to plan, the TCV numbers should see a stepup in the coming quarters.” Financial services were up 6.8 per cent, technology 13.7 per cent, and telecommunications 13 per cent. The manufacturing and life sciences verticals were down 1 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, because uncertainties persisted in those sectors owing to concerns over trade tariffs. While growth in the United States, the biggest market that contributes about 60 per cent to the top line, remained muted, Europe was up 9.6 per cent while business from other geographies, excluding India, was up 15 per cent. “Steady bookings, artificial intelligence/GenAI adoption, a robust pipeline and management commentary on non-deterioration of demand environment position it well for FY26. While near-term uncertainties may impact discretionary spending, HCLTech’s diversified portfolio and AI-driven solutions ensure long-term growth potential,” wrote Shaji Nair, research analyst, Mirae Asset Sharekhan. Operating margins, however, dropped to 16.3 per cent from 17.1 per cent year-on-year. “The margins were lower than what we had planned. While Q1 has been historically low for us, the margins were below expectations as utilisation dropped due to a delay in rampup of a specific programme. We also encountered rampdowns in specific areas. Also there was a demand supply mismatch between skills and locations and a client bankruptcy,” the CEO said. The headcount dropped by 269 to stand at 223,151 at the end of June, while attrition remained flat sequentially at 12.8 per cent. The company took on board 1,984 fresh engineering graduates in the last three months. HCL will also add people with specialised skills in AI, cybersecurity, and digital engineering. They will account for 15-20 per cent of fresh hiring. “We will also be undertaking some restructuring in facilities which we are not utilising outside India which are related to acquisitions. Also there will be some talent ramp downs in some geographies outside India and expect during the second and third quarter and a small part in the last,” Vijayakumar added. Meanwhile, the first-quarter performance of India’s largest IT services provider, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), continued to reflect the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and slow discretionary spending. The firm’s management remained optimistic overall, but admitted that high single-digit growth looks tough. TCS reported a net profit of ₹12,760 crore for the first quarter of FY26, up 6 per cent compared to ₹12,040 crore in the same period of FY25. Revenue grew 1.3 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) in reported terms to ₹63,437 crore in Q1FY26. Sequentially, the company’s revenue was down by 1.6 per cent, the slowest quarterly growth since Q1FY21, when revenue fell 4 per cent quarter-on-quarter due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Prior to that, TCS had reported a sequential revenue decline of 0.2 per cent in Q1FY18.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "11:43 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T23:43:00", "topics": ["HCL Technologies", "HCL Technologies Results", "HCL tech stock"], "author": "Avik Das", "premium": "False"}

According to sources, the markets regulator is examining related entities and trading strategies across exchanges and indices, expanding the current probe, which is limited to only 15 expiries of Nifty Bank and three for the Nifty 50 index. The investigation, which involves sophisticated forensic tools, could stretch beyond six months, said people with knowledge of the matter. Jane Street is estimated to have made ₹43,289 crore in equity options through index-based trades between January and March 2025. Sebi has not deemed the entire sum illegal. In a 105-page interim order, Sebi temporarily barred Jane Street for allegedly manipulating the Bank Nifty index and ordered the largest ever impounding of “unlawfully” gained profits (₹4,844 crore) in India’s securities markets. The firm was given 21 days to respond to the allegations. In an internal communication, Jane Street described Sebi’s order as “fundamentally mistaken”. The New York-based firm is expected to soon file an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). Shares of BSE Ltd, India’s only listed stock exchange, rose nearly 4 per cent following the announcement. The stock had dropped 15 per cent earlier this month after Sebi’s ban on Jane Street triggered a 20 per cent plunge in futures & options turnover. The sources said any return by Jane Street to the Indian markets would be closely monitored by both Sebi and the exchanges. The regulator has directed exchanges to track the firm’s positions and trades on an ongoing basis until the probe concludes. “Sebi remains committed to following due process and ensuring the integrity of the securities market,” said the regulator in a statement. Jane Street’s strategy involved aggressively buying the Bank Nifty constituent stocks in both cash and futures segments, to artificially inflate the index. Later in the day, it offloaded those positions, while holding large short positions in index options, profiting from the index’s decline. Jane Street said these trades were part of a standard “index arbitrage” strategy — trading on the price differences between related instruments to provide liquidity and maintain market efficiency. In internal communications, the firm had described Sebi’s order as “extremely inflammatory” and argued that the order disregarded the legitimate role of arbitrageurs in modern markets.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "11:25 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T23:25:00", "topics": ["SEBI", "Sebi norms", "Markets", "BSE NSE", "Securities and Exchange Board of India"], "author": "Samie Modak", "premium": "False"}

The proposal has been incorporated as part of a draft notification to amend the Minerals (Other than Atomic and Hydro Carbons Energy Minerals) Concession Rules, 2016. The amendment will come into effect upon its publication in the official gazette. Trade industry sources said at present, India hardly produces any rock phosphate of grades suitable for manufacturing of good quality DAP, but if domestic miners are incentivised adequately, they might look for the same within the country. Presently, almost all the raw materials that go into making DAP — namely rock phosphate, phosphoric acid, and ammonia — are imported into India from countries like Jordan and Morocco. More than half of the country’s annual DAP requirement is imported in finished form. Annually, India consumes around 10-11 million tonnes (mt) of DAP. Recently, finished DAP prices have reached almost their record levels of $1,000 per tonne at around $800 per tonne due to squeeze in supplies from China, and also disruption in supplies from West Asia because of the Iran-Israel conflict. The high prices coupled with low opening stocks have meant that farmers across the country are facing an acute shortage of DAP at present, leading to long queues outside sale centres. Meanwhile, the draft notification said that the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) will use a three-part formula to determine the average sale price of rock phosphate. It will be calculated by multiplying the cost and freight (CFR) price of rock phosphate, as published by the Department of Fertilisers, with the monthly average exchange rate of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The result will then be adjusted with a grade-based conversion factor. The draft amendment categorises rock phosphate into four grades based on the percentage of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) content. The highest conversion factor of 0.85 applies to phosphate with more than 30 per cent P2O5 while the lowest factor of 0.22 is for material with P2O5 of 20 per cent or less. Globally, imported price of rock phosphate has been trading at around $175-180 per tonne. Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia’s Maaden, one of the world's leading manufacturer of DAP, signed a long-term agreement with three Indian fertiliser companies — Indian Potash Limited (IPL), KRIBHCO, and Chambal Fertilisers (CIL) — for the supply of 3.1 mt of DAP annually for five years starting 2025-26 (FY26). The agreement also includes a provision for a five-year extension based on mutual consent. In 2022, Coromandel International Ltd, India’s leading phosphatic fertiliser player, had acquired 45 per cent equity in Baobab Mining and Chemicals Corporation (BMCC), a rock phosphate mining company based in Senegal.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "11:21 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T23:21:00", "topics": ["agriculture economy", "agricultural", "Mining industry"], "author": "Saket Kumar", "premium": "False"}

The airlines have to submit the inspection reports by July 21, DGCA said on Monday. The DGCA directive is significant against the backdrop of the recent Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) report, which stated that both engine fuel-control switches on the Boeing 787 aircraft on flight AI171 had “transitioned” from RUN to CUTOFF just seconds after takeoff, resulting in a dual engine failure. The aviation safety regulator’s order will apply to Boeing 737 and 787, which are equipped with fuel-control switches manufactured by American conglomerate Honeywell International. Boeing 777 aircraft, which features a different type of fuel-control switches, is not covered under the DGCA directive. AAIB’s preliminary report, made public on Saturday, has been widely criticised for omission of key technical details related to the crash, which killed 241 on board and 19 on the ground on June 12. Among Indian carriers, the inspection applies to Boeing aircraft in the fleets of five airlines. Air India operates 191 aircraft in total, of which 57 are Boeing jets, including 787s and 777s. Air India Express has 75 Boeing 737s in its 114-aircraft fleet. IndiGo, with a total fleet of 414 aircraft, has 10 Boeing 777, 787s and 737s acquired on lease. SpiceJet operates 29 Boeing aircraft out of 55 in its fleet, while Akasa Air’s entire fleet of 30 aircraft comprises Boeing 737 MAX planes, according to planespotters.net. Only Air India and IndiGo have Boeing 777s, which are not covered under the DGCA’s inspection directive. While the cause of the fuel-control switch transitioning to the cutoff position remains undetermined, international airlines such as Singapore Airlines and Etihad Airways have taken early action. In the last couple of days, the airlines started inspecting the fuel-control switches on their Boeing 787 fleet. When asked about these inspections, the Etihad Airways spokesperson said: “Etihad always ensures its maintenance is fully compliant.” The Singapore Airlines spokesperson did not respond to Business Standard’s queries. South Korea, meanwhile, was also preparing to mandate inspections of fuel-control switches on all Boeing aircraft in the country. A spokesperson for the South Korean transport ministry on Monday said the upcoming checks would follow the guidance of the 2018 advisory issued by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), though no specific timeline for completion was provided. The AAIB report had on Saturday revealed that the Boeing 787 involved in the crash was equipped with the same fuel control switches flagged in the FAA’s 2018 bulletin. Air India told investigators it had not carried out the recommended inspections at the time, citing the advisory nature of the bulletin. The aircraft’s throttle control module had been replaced in 2019 and 2023, though not due to any issue related to the fuel switches. In its Monday order, the DGCA noted that the FAA had in December 2018 issued a special airworthiness information bulletin (SAIB) -- number NM-18-33 -- regarding the potential for disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature on multiple Boeing models, including the 737, 747, 757, 767, 787, and others. The FAA had in 2018 received reports that in some cases, the fuel control switches were installed in a way that bypassed or disabled the locking mechanism, which is meant to prevent accidental movement of the switch from the “RUN” to “CUTOFF” position. Without the lock engaged, the switches could potentially be moved more easily, raising the risk of unintentional engine shutdown during flight. Though the FAA had determined that the issue did not constitute an “unsafe condition” requiring a mandatory airworthiness directive, it had recommended that operators inspect the switches and replace any with disengaged locking features. It specifically advised a part upgrade for certain 737 models with switches built by Honeywell. The SAIB was advisory and not mandatory. The DGCA on Monday noted that several domestic and international airlines have now initiated such inspections. Therefore, it instructed all Indian operators of affected aircraft to “complete the inspection required under SAIB Number: NM-18-33...no later than July 21, 2025”. Operators must also submit an inspection plan and post-inspection report to the DGCA and the concerned regional office. “Strict adherence to the timeline is essential to ensure continued airworthiness and safety of operations,” the DGCA added in its order. According to flight data cited in the AAIB report, the switches on both engines of AI171 moved from “RUN” to “CUTOFF” just three seconds after the aircraft lifted off from runway 23 of Ahmedabad airport on June 12. The two movements occurred one second apart. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why the fuel was cut off, to which the other replied that he had not done it. A Mayday call was made seconds later before the aircraft crashed into the BJ Medical College hostel compound.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "11:05 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T23:05:00", "topics": ["DGCA", "Boeing", "Aviation industry"], "author": "Deepak Patel", "premium": "False"}

This milestone — for Tata Steel and British steelmaking — was marked by a groundbreaking event on Monday where Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Steel and the Tata group, was joined by government ministers. He was flanked by Tata Steel chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD) TV Narendran and Tata Steel UK CEO Rajesh Nair as they officially broke the ground with spades. This marked the official start of construction for the UK’s largest low-carbon steelmaking facility — a shift from traditional blast furnaces. This is part of a pound 1.25 billion transformation programme supported by a pound 500 million investment from the UK government. The new EAF — having a capacity of 3 million tonnes (mt) — is set to be commissioned at the end of 2027. It is expected to reduce Port Talbot’s carbon emissions by around 90 per cent. The transition secures 5,000 jobs across Tata Steel UK even as the closure of heavy-end assets is said to be impacting close to 2,500 jobs. Speaking at the event, Chandrasekaran said, it was a very important milestone for Port Talbot. “Frankly, I have to say that this site has gone through several ups and downs,” adding that the transformation was a “historic moment.” “I am so glad that when we proposed this project and finally the UK government approved our proposal and all the unions, the local management — everyone came together to embark on this journey. Since then, we have been moving along according to the original plan,” he added. “Many naysayers probably thought that this day would not come. And that’s why it’s very important,” the Tata group chairman pointed out. The Tata group, he said, was super-committed to the project. “We got a job in hand, we got to execute. We will get this project done and commission it by end-2027.” The Port Talbot project is part of Tata group’s wider investment in the UK, across steel, automotive, and technology, among others. In a statement, earlier in the day, British business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said, “This is our industrial strategy in action and is great news for Welsh steelmaking backing this crucial Welsh industry, which will give certainty to local communities and thousands of local jobs for years to come.” Secretary of state for Wales Jo Stevens said, “The UK government acted decisively to ensure that steelmaking in Port Talbot will continue for generations to come, backing Tata Steel with pound 500 million to secure its future in the town, along with pound 80 million to support workers and the wider community.” Secretary of state for Wales Jo Stevens said, “The UK government acted decisively to ensure that steelmaking in Port Talbot will continue for generations to come, backing Tata Steel with pound 500 million to secure its future in the town, along with pound 80 million to support workers and the wider community.” “Our steel strategy will also deliver pound 2.5 billion of investment to rebuild the UK industry, maintain jobs and drive growth,” Stevens added. First Minister Eluned Morgan said, “The start of the construction phase is good news for Port Talbot and neighbouring communities, and I’m especially pleased that Tata has committed to employing local contractors and local workers where it can.” Steelworkers’ union community described it as a “bittersweet” day. In a statement, community assistant general secretary Alasdair McDiarmid, \"This bittersweet day is a consequence of the devastating closure of the blast furnaces, but importantly a future for Port Talbot steelmaking is being secured. The workforce needs the electric arc furnace project to be both a success and a turning point, and we look forward to playing our part to get the new furnace up and running.” As part of Tata Steel UK’s broader decarbonisation strategy, the steel firm said that the project also includes new ladle metallurgy facilities, infrastructure upgrades, and partnerships with technology providers such as Tenova, ABB, and Clecim.

The EU is America's biggest business partner and the world's largest trading bloc. The US decision will have repercussions for governments, companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. We shouldn't impose countermeasures at this stage, but we should prepare to be ready to use all the tools in the toolbox, said Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Lkke Rasmussen, told reporters ahead of the meeting. So we want a deal, but there's an old saying: 'If you want peace, you have to prepare for war.' The tariffs, also imposed on Mexico, are set to start on Aug 1 and could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the US, and destabilise economies from Portugal to Norway. Meanwhile, Brussels decided to suspend retaliatory tariffs on US goods scheduled to take effect Monday in hopes of reaching a trade deal with the Trump administration by the end of the month. The countermeasures by the EU, which negotiates trade deals on behalf of its 27 member countries, will be delayed until Aug 1. Trump's letter shows that we have until the first of August to negotiate, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday. The letters to the EU and Mexico come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade. Trump in April imposed tariffs on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, he began sending tariff letters to leaders but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks. If he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy. In the wake of the new tariffs, European leaders largely closed ranks, calling for unity but also a steady hand to not provoke further acrimony. Just last week, Europe was cautiously optimistic. Officials told reporters on Friday they weren't expecting a letter like the one sent Saturday and that a trade deal was to be inked in the coming days\". For months, the EU has broadcast that it has strong retaliatory measures ready if talks fail. Reeling from successive rebukes from Washington, the EU is now diversifying its economic, political and defense networks, mostly in Asia. The EU top brass will visit Beijing fora summit later this month while courting other Pacific nations like South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia, whose prime minister visited Brussels over the weekend to sign a new economic partnership with the EU. It also has mega-deals in the works with Mexico and a trading bloc of South American nations known as Mercosur.

Trump said the missiles are essential to defend the country because Russian President Vladimir Putin \"talks nice but then he bombs everybody in the evening\", reported Reuters. \"But there's a little bit of a problem there. I don't like it\", he added. “We’re not paying anything for them,” Trump said. “But we will get them Patriots, which they desperately need.” Trump also clarified the financial arrangement for the arms transfer. “We basically are going to send them various pieces of very sophisticated military equipment. They are going to pay us 100 per cent for that, and that's the way we want it,” he said. Reversal in Trump's stance on Ukraine conflict Since beginning his second term, Trump had blocked new arms deliveries to Ukraine, preferring to engage Putin diplomatically. Trump maintained he could end the war where his predecessor Joe Biden had failed. During this period, Ukraine continued receiving US weapons solely through funding allocated under the Biden administration, reported Bloomberg. Trump had resisted requesting additional congressional appropriations, arguing that more military aid would provoke Putin and diminish chances for a negotiated settlement. Trump hints of policy shift amid intensifying Russian attacks Last week, Trump hinted at a major announcement regarding Russia scheduled for Monday, July 14, but did not clarify whether it would involve new sanctions currently under consideration in Congress. On the same day, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is expected to meet with Trump, potentially influencing further decisions. Trump’s evolving position comes in the wake of a recent escalation in Russian attacks. Putin has launched a series of intense aerial bombardments on Ukrainian cities while dismissing calls for a ceasefire. This has increasingly frustrated Trump, who now appears more open to supplying Ukraine with defensive weapons. He had earlier reversed a Pentagon decision to pause some arms shipments, signalling renewed commitment to supporting Kyiv. Shift in Trumps' tone towards Zelenskyy Trump’s recent comments mark a clear departure from his earlier stance on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. During his campaign and the early months of his current term, Trump had dismissed Zelenskyy as an impediment to peace, referring to him in February as a “modestly successful comedian” and a “dictator\", while criticising the extent of US military and financial aid to Ukraine. Now, however, Trump appears more open to working with Ukraine’s leadership, amid mounting Russian attacks. Following a recent meeting in Rome with US and European allies, Zelenskyy said he was encouraged by what he described as a “positive dialogue” with Trump regarding the delivery of additional air defence systems, including Patriot missiles. \"Following our constructive and very positive discussions with President Trump, it is vital that we now have clear political signals supporting the resumption of aid shipments,” Zelenskyy said in Rome on July 10. “Work is now underway at the staff level to ensure timely delivery of assistance to Ukraine.”", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "10:47 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T22:47:00", "topics": ["Donald Trump", "Volodymyr Zelensky", "Russia Ukraine Conflict", "Ukraine", "Trump administration", "BS Web Reports"], "author": "Vrinda Goel", "premium": "False"}

This follows Viceroy Research’s July 9 report alleging governance issues at Vedanta, which caused an intraday stock plunge of nearly 8 per cent. While acknowledging short-selling as a legitimate, regulated activity that aids market liquidity and price discovery, InGovern has emphasised that such reports often serve the financial interests of their authors. Critical research reports by short-sellers with negative interpretation of public data may lead to market reactions bordering on panic, which may benefit the short-seller financially from subsequent movements in stock or bond prices, the report noted. InGovern highlighted a significant regulatory gap — foreign entities like Viceroy, which are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), can publish reports impacting Indian markets without facing domestic scrutiny. “Foreign research outfits not registered with Sebi can publish reports on Indian companies without being subject to Indian regulatory scrutiny — even when their actions directly impact Indian investors and markets,” stated InGovern, referencing similar past incidents like Hindenburg Research’s report that prompted regulatory reforms. Sebi mandates registration for research analysts covering Indian securities, ensuring accountability and oversight. However, this applies only to domestic entities. On Vedanta, InGovern advised contextual analysis of short-seller claims, noting that debt servicing through subsidiaries is common globally if transparently managed. The firm also observed increased investor scrutiny of Vedanta’s related-party transactions and capital allocation in recent shareholder meetings. Meanwhile, industry voices, including Zerodha founder Nithin Kamath, underscored India’s structural lack of short-selling mechanisms. “Unless we make shorting of stocks easy in the Indian markets, price discovery will be impaired. India has been a structurally long-only market, with almost no shorting activity, because borrowing stock to short is really hard and is an offline process,” Kamath wrote on his social media handles, highlighting the lack of short-selling talent.

The tax demand was based on a 2021 government notification that sought to clarify and retrospectively amend a 2017 exemption. The government had challenged the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) ruling of August 2024, which rejected the retrospective tax demand, stating that it would place an additional burden on airlines. A bench comprising Justices B.V. Nagarathna and K.V. Viswanathan on Monday refused to admit the customs department’s appeal and dismissed it. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) N. Venkataraman, appearing for the customs department, argued that nearly ₹100 crore in tax revenue was at stake. He also submitted that the interpretation of the 2017 notification is already under challenge before the Supreme Court. “Even if the 2021 notification is struck down for being retrospective, our case survives because duties of customs under the 2017 notification include IGST. All I am requesting is that if we win on the 2017 notification, the benefit of that ruling should apply to these bills [and] other imports as well,” he said. The court, however, rejected the argument, stating: “You can’t do it by a retrospective amendment… If the 2017 notification did not cover IGST, you cannot use the 2021 notification to impose it retrospectively.” The government has announced that a uniform IGST rate of 5 per cent on all aircraft and aircraft engine parts will come into effect from 15 July. Last week, the 53rd GST Council recommended a uniform 5 per cent tax on imports of parts, components, testing equipment, tools, and toolkits of aircraft, irrespective of their HSN code. The aim is to reduce operational costs, resolve tax credit issues, and attract investment. IndiGo has also challenged the constitutionality of the 2021 notification before the Delhi High Court. On 4 March, the High Court struck down the additional tax imposed on the repair cost of goods re-imported into India after being sent abroad for maintenance. The airline’s parent company argued that it had already paid import duties on overseas repairs as part of the import of services and should not be taxed again upon the re-import of the repaired aircraft parts. IndiGo, which is principally engaged in the transportation of passengers and goods by air within and outside India, sends its goods to maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) service providers outside the country. Once repaired, the goods are re-imported. S.R. Patnaik, Partner and Head of Taxation Practice at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said the Supreme Court’s decision to dismiss the revenue’s plea reinforces a vital principle in tax jurisprudence—that retrospective tax demands must pass the test of fairness and legal certainty. “This ruling provides much-needed reassurance to businesses that tax exemptions, once validly claimed, will not be reopened by retrospective changes. It will likely influence how courts approach other cases involving retrospective levies, and hence, it is expected that the tax authorities shall use their powers in a more restrained manner,” he said. “This precedent strengthens challenges in sectors like online gaming, where the retrospective levy of GST on the face value of bets is under judicial scrutiny. The ruling signals that tax certainty cannot be achieved by imposing obligations retrospectively, a development that certainly restores hope among taxpayers,” said Karan Sarawagi, an advocate practising in the Bombay High Court. “The Supreme Court's decision is rooted in the jurisprudential principle that notifications are inherently prospective in nature. Since this was a notification and not a legislative clarification, its applicability should always be considered prospective, starting from the date of its publication in the official gazette,” said Sachin Sharma, Managing Partner of KSV Tax Consultants.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "10:20 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T22:20:00", "topics": ["IndiGo Airlines", "InterGlobe Aviation", "Supreme Court", "Aviation industry"], "author": "Bhavini Mishra", "premium": "False"}

Jaishankar said the two neighbours should also normalise people-to-people contacts and avoid “restrictive trade measures and roadblocks”. He underlined the need for cooperation on trans-border rivers and urged the Chinese side to resume providing hydrological data. In his opening remarks at his meeting with the Chinese foreign minister in Beijing, Jaishankar said relations between the two countries can continue to develop on a “positive trajectory” on the foundation that differences should not become disputes and competition should not become conflict. Alluding to China restricting the supply of critical minerals and flagging the need to foster mutually beneficial cooperation, including through people-to-people exchanges, Jaishankar said, “It is also essential in this context that restrictive trade measures and roadblocks are avoided.” He said he hoped to discuss these issues in further detail with Wang. Jaishankar landed in Beijing on Sunday, after a day-long visit to Singapore, to attend the Meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Foreign Ministers Council in Tianjin, which is 135 kilometre from Beijing. China is the current president of the SCO and will host the SCO Summit in Tianjin later this year, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend. Jaishankar last visited China from August 11-13, 2019 — his first visit to the country after assuming office as India’s EAM in June that year. As Jaishankar noted in his remarks, India-China relations have been gradually moving in a “positive direction” after Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in China’s Kazan in October 2024. “Our responsibility is to maintain that momentum,” Jaishankar said, adding that the India-China bilateral relationship requires that “we take a far-seeing approach to our ties”. India’s EAM noted that Wang and he have met in recent months on several occasions at international events and carried out strategic communication. “It is our expectation that this will now be regular and take place in each other’s countries,” Jaishankar said. India-China foreign ministers’ level talks had been discontinued after the Galwan clashes of June-July 2020. Jaishankar noted that India and China mark the 75th year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and appreciated Chinese cooperation in the resumption of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra after a gap of five years. He said the resolution of friction along the India-China border and the ability of the two countries to maintain peace and tranquillity there was the “fundamental basis” of the “good progress” made in the past nine months for the normalisation of bilateral relations. Jaishankar called for “stable and constructive ties” between the two neighbours, which he said could best be achieved by handling relations on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest, and mutual sensitivity. “We have also earlier agreed that differences should not become disputes, nor should competition ever become conflict. On this foundation, we can now continue to develop our ties along a positive trajectory,” he said. Jaishankar and Wang will also exchange views on global and regional issues. As for the SCO meeting, scheduled for Monday, Jaishankar said India “hopes” that the grouping will “strongly” uphold its mandate of zero tolerance for terrorism. At the SCO’s meeting of defence ministers in China’s Qingdao in June, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had refused to sign a joint communiqué as it omitted the Pahalgam terror attack and did not explicitly address India’s concerns over Pakistan-backed cross-border terrorism. In Beijing, the EAM also called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, where he noted the “steadily improving” bilateral ties since the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan last October. He said it is “very important” for India and China, as neighbouring countries and major economies, to have an open exchange of views and perspectives in the context of the complex international situation. In Singapore on Saturday, Jaishankar met Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and other ministers, including Teo Chee Hean, who is the coordinating minister for national security and chairman-designate of Temasek Holdings. Their discussion focused on the transformation underway in India and opportunities for Temasek to expand its investments in India, the Ministry of External Affairs said.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "10:06 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T22:06:00", "topics": ["S Jaishankar", "Wang Yi", "India China relations", "Border tension"], "author": "Archis Mohan", "premium": "False"}

Speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry’s GCC Business Summit, the FM said, “There’s a lot of work to do. Equally, there is great opportunity for us. So together, with all heads put together, we'll be able to get some concrete steps on which I assure you the best of attention will be given by the Government of India.” Stressing that India should not lose this advantage, Sitharaman said that while taxation was one issue being faced by GCCs, there was a need to lubricate the entire administrative and governing mechanism top-down to ensure the advantages are available for everyone to capture across the country. In her Budget 2025 speech, Sitharaman had announced that a national framework would be formulated to guide states in promoting GCCs in emerging Tier-II cities. “This will suggest 16 measures for enhancing availability of talent and infrastructure, building by-law reforms, and mechanisms for collaboration with industry,” the FM had said. She added that some work had been done on advance pricing and tax-related rulings in the last Budget. Highlighting that the setup rate of engineering, research, and development GCCs has been 1.3x faster than the overall GCC setup rate over the last five years, Sitharaman said there was a clear shift towards high value-added work in India. “India’s unique strength lies in its immense talent pool, accounting for 28 per cent of the global science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and 23 per cent of the global software engineering talent,” the FM said, stressing that over 32 per cent of global GCC talent is currently based in India. Sitharaman also said that India’s talent is more cost-effective compared to other countries, costing 30–50 per cent less than in the US, the UK, and Australia. Global roles within India’s GCCs, the FM said, are expected to increase from 6,500 today to over 30,000 by 2030 through robust in-house training programmes that nurture globally ready leadership. “Over the past decade, India’s GCC ecosystem has matured significantly, moving beyond execution to become centres of strategic leadership and transformation. Many GCCs now house high-end roles, including product managers, architects, data scientists, and global function heads,” the FM said. Sitharaman highlighted that, on average, one new GCC per week was set up in 2024, with nearly 50 per cent of Fortune 500 companies establishing their GCCs in India.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "10:03 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T22:03:00", "topics": ["Nirmala Sitharaman", "Indian investments into GCC", "Finance Ministry", "Indian Economy"], "author": "Ruchika Chitravanshi", "premium": "False"}

In their last 13 completed Tests, India have managed to win just four matches, draw one, and suffer eight defeats. This difficult stretch includes a shocking 0–3 whitewash at home against New Zealand—a first in over a decade—and a 1–3 defeat to Australia that saw them relinquish the Border–Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in ten years. These results have come under the new leadership of head coach Gautam Gambhir, who took over the reins from Rahul Dravid in 2024. Gambhir's red-ball strategy has revolved heavily around the inclusion of multiple all-rounders—a ploy designed to deepen the batting line-up and offer more bowling options. While this tactic worked wonders in white-ball formats, with India even clinching the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, its translation into Test cricket has been far less convincing. In most matches, the so-called all-rounders have delivered in only one department, if at all. The lack of consistent dual-impact performances has left India exposed to both batting collapses and bowling fatigue. However, amidst the underwhelming returns from India’s all-round department, Ravindra Jadeja has stood tall as the lone ray of sunshine. In a team still trying to find the right balance and rhythm under a new coaching philosophy, Jadeja’s consistency—even if not always spectacular—has offered a much-needed sense of stability. While the larger experiment of relying on all-rounders is yet to find its feet in Test cricket, Ravindra Jadeja continues to quietly remind the cricketing world why he’s among the finest red-ball all-rounders of his generation. But how has Jadeja fared in numbers so far in the Gautam Gambhir era? Take a look. India vs Bangladesh 2024: Strong Start to Gambhir Era Gambhir’s first assignment as Test coach saw India hosting Bangladesh, where Jadeja underlined his all-round pedigree. In the first Test, when India’s top order crumbled, it was Jadeja’s composed 86 that helped resurrect the innings alongside Ashwin. With the ball, he added further value by taking five wickets, playing a crucial role in India’s comfortable win. Though his bat didn’t speak loudly in the second Test (8 runs), he still contributed with the ball—four wickets—to seal the series 2–0. If not dominant in both roles at once, Jadeja still ensured impact in every game. India vs New Zealand 2024: Lone Spark in a Tough Series In a series India would rather forget—losing 0–3 at home—Jadeja still stood up when needed. While he had a quiet first Test (5 runs, 3 wickets), he bounced back in the second with a solid 80-run effort and three wickets, showcasing his value even when others failed. The third Test was arguably his best of the series—10 wickets in the match. His batting contribution was minimal (20 runs), but Jadeja’s bowling was instrumental in keeping India competitive. Though the team faltered, Jadeja remained a pillar of contribution, especially with the ball. Australia vs India 2024–25: Adjusting Roles, Adapting Quickly Jadeja missed the first two Tests but returned in the third and made an immediate statement with the bat—a fluent 77-run knock that helped India post a strong total. Even though he couldn’t claim a wicket, he contributed as a batter with patience and intent. In the fourth Test, Jadeja was India’s best bowler, bagging four wickets, though he scored just 19 runs. The fifth Test was a rare complete off-game for him—no wickets, 39 runs—but across the series, Jadeja showed the ability to respond to specific match demands, whether with bat or ball. England vs India 2025: Jadeja Leads with the Bat in Transition Phase With India entering a new era post the retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, Jadeja remained a vital cog. In the first Test against England, he managed only 36 runs and a solitary wicket, but the second Test saw him step up significantly with the bat—89 in the first innings and 69 in the second. While he just took one wicket, his 158-run match tally was a crucial reason why India registered their first-ever win at Edgbaston. In the third Test again, Jadeja contributed heavily with the bat, scoring 72 runs in the first innings and 61 not out runs in the second. He only took one wicket, but again he was there for India—at least in one role, if not both—as an all-rounder, cementing his position as Mr Consistent. Overall Performance of Indian All-rounders Under Gambhir Now coming to overall stats for all-rounders in Gambhir era , Jadeja—with 661 runs and 31 wickets—has justified his position as an all-rounder. Sundar took 23 wickets in seven matches, including 11 in his first match, and scored only 290 runs, while Reddy, in a similar number of matches, scored only 334, including a 114-run innings, but has only six wickets to his name. Now-retired Ashwin, in six matches, took 22 wickets but scored just 197 runs despite starting with a 113-run innings, while Thakur, in the only game he played, took only two wickets and scored five runs. This data proves that, if we take the overall numbers into account, Jadeja still looks far better than any other player in the same role for the team. Mix his performance with experience and his exceptional skills as a fielder, and Jadeja is currently the most needed player in the side. India will rely heavily on him to pass through the ongoing transition period.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "9:52 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T21:52:00", "topics": ["Gautam Gambhir", "India vs England", "India cricket team", "ICC World Test Championship", "England cricket team", "Test Cricket", "Ravindra Jadeja"], "author": "Aditya Kaushik", "premium": "False"}

Anyway, so — yes, I made every decision.” Thousands received sentence reductions Biden’s clemency actions covered three broad areas:- Around 1,500 individuals in pandemic-related home confinement were allowed to remain outside prison. Roughly 2,500 non-violent drug offenders had their sentences reduced to align with updated sentencing norms. 37 of the 40 federal death row inmates had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment without parole. Pardons were also granted to several individuals whose cases had drawn political attention, including members of the January 6 Capitol riot committee, Capitol Police officers who testified, Dr Anthony S Fauci, retired General Mark A Milley, and members of Biden’s own family. Legal use of autopen defended Biden clarified the use of the autopen — an authorised mechanical signature tool — as a matter of practicality. “Because there were a lot of them.” “The autopen is, you know, legal. As you know, other presidents used it, including Trump. But the point is that, you know, we’re talking about a whole lot of people.” Republicans have launched investigations, suggesting Biden’s aides may have acted without authorisation. Mr Trump has labelled the clemency acts “illegitimate”. But Biden rejected these claims outright. “They’re liars. They know it. They know, for certain. I mean, this is — look, what they, they’ve had a pretty good thing going here. They’ve done so badly. They’ve lied so consistently about almost everything they’re doing. The best thing they can do is try to change the focus and focus on something else. And this is a — I think that’s what this is about.” “It’s — you know — it’s consistent with Trump’s game plan all along. I mean, if I — I don’t expect you to answer any questions — but if I told you three years ago, we’d have a president doing this, I think you’d look at me in the eye and say, ‘What, are you, crazy?’” Pre-emptive pardons for family Acknowledging that he issued pardons to family members, Biden said it was a precautionary measure against politically motivated investigations. “In terms of my family — he — goes after me through my family. I know how vindictive he is. I mean, everybody knows how vindictive he is. So we knew that they’d do what they’re doing now. And my family didn’t do anything wrong. My sister, my brother-in-law, my — my brother, etc... I just, I just know how he operates. And so I made — but I consciously made all those decisions, among others.” Strategy behind clemency Biden explained that he had categorised clemency cases and communicated his decisions clearly to aides, especially in high-profile matters like those involving General Milley and members of the Capitol riot committee. “Well, first of all, there’s categories. So, you know, they aren’t reading names off for the commutations for those who had been home confinement for, during the pandemic. So the only things that really we read off names for were, for example, you know, was I, what was I going to do about, for example, Mark Milley?” “Mark’s a good guy. We know how vindictive Trump is and I’ve no doubt they would have gone after Mark for no good reason. The general, you know. So they may read off his name — what’d I want? I told them I wanted to make sure he had a pardon because I knew exactly what Trump would do — without any merit, I might add.” “And you know, you know, members of the January 6 committee — it’s just, there were no — I was deeply involved. I laid out a strategy how I want to go about these, dealing with pardons and commutations. I was — and I pulled the team in to say this is how I want to get it done generically and then specifically. And so, you know, that’s just — this is how it worked.” Reversal on Don Siegelman Biden also spoke about reversing his decision to pardon former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman. “Look, Siegelman was out of jail. He had served his time. And there was no — so he wasn’t in jeopardy. And what I concluded was, there’s — and these aren’t easy decisions, but there are a lot of people who are considered for pardons. And I was proud I ran the process I ran.” “These decisions took time. In this case, I viewed the facts, reflected on it a bit more, and deliberated more on it with my team and decided not to grant the pardon. And I didn’t make this decision quickly. I made it thoroughly and after significant discussion.” Last-minute pardon backed by Clyburn Biden confirmed he had added a pardon for a former South Carolina official after lobbying from Representative Jim Clyburn. “The case that Jim — and I have great faith in Jim — the case he made, the plea he made at the very end, was that — he made a compelling case that he was a person who had dedicated his life to public service, Cromartie. Since his release from prison, he became really involved in the community, helping underprivileged kids, staying active with his church. And he’s someone who has been praised for his leadership and compassion for others.” “So the very thing that he sort of got in trouble for, he was not only — served time, but he was making up for it. And I believed granting him a pardon was the right thing to do. There were decisions I made — this decision I made quickly and easily as Jim laid the case out.” “What he was doing now, that was almost a continuation of his apology for what the hell happened when he committed the offence. So I agreed with Jim and I pardoned him. And he’s still decent — this guy still is engaged, stays engaged in the community.” 3 death row cases left unchanged Explaining why three death-row inmates did not receive clemency, Biden said the crimes involved broader national trauma and terrorism. “Those three, because they became — they were involved in what were major, major issues relating to terrorism and crimes that were — had national implications. One — for example, I was deeply involved in the one having to do with the church and I was down there.” “It just seemed to me that it was going to be — it was just a bridge too far. And so that’s why I didn’t pardon those three, because they had a national implication that stood for things beyond the crime they committed. It was a reflection of what they did to the entire nation and the community.” “And so, that’s what I withheld from them. I spoke to the pope about this, by the way. I was — I had a discussion about — he called me to congratulate me on keeping my word about not supporting the death penalty.” “But I told him I couldn’t do the last three. And, that’s, that, that’s the reason because it’s sort of like, you know, the guy who, — you know, I’m making this up — assassinates Abraham Lincoln. You don’t, you know, you can’t pardon him because there's such a gigantic implication for things that go well beyond that individual murder. That was my decision, anyway. Some thought I should have, but I decided not to do those three.”", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "9:49 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T21:49:00", "topics": ["Joe Biden", "Donald Trump", "US President", "United States"], "author": "Prateek Shukla", "premium": "False"}

England pacers ripped apart the Indian batting line-up with precision as the visitors were bundled out for 170 despite lower order fightback, as the hosts won the match by 22 runs and went 2-1 up in the series. It will be a do-or-die situation for India when they take the field for the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, starting Wednesday, July 23, as one more loss will mean England will walk away with another home series win against India. England start with bat For the first time in the series, England, after winning the toss, opted to bat first in the third Test at Lord’s. It was a quite unusual innings from England as they played without their aggressive style of play, that is Bazball. Joe Root (104) scored a record 37th century to lead from the front and was complemented well by half-centuries from Jamie Smith (51) and Brydon Carse (56), and cameos from Ollie Pope (44) and Ben Stokes (44), as they finished with 387 for 10 after 112.3 overs. Jasprit Bumrah, with a brilliant five-wicket haul, was India’s best bowler in the innings. India reply on equal terms In a very rare moment, India also finished their first innings on 387, with KL Rahul (100) being the top scorer for his side. Rishabh Pant (74) and Ravindra Jadeja (72) also scored brilliant half-centuries, while Washington Sundar (23) and Nitish Reddy (30) played handy cameos to keep India on level terms after the first innings. Chris Woakes, with three wickets, was England’s best bowler in the innings. Sundar shines in third innings In the third innings of the match and second innings of England, it was Indian spinner Washington Sundar who stole the show with his brilliant spell of 4 for 22 as India bundled England out for just 192. Joe Root (40) and Ben Stokes (33) were the two top scorers for England in the innings. English pacers strike back In the final innings, India, chasing 193, started with confidence but were soon hit with a huge reality check about the Lord’s wicket as English pacers fired back in style. Archer, Carse and Stokes combined their ruthless attack to reduce India to 82 for 7 in mere chase, turning the tide of the match in their favour. Nitish Reddy tried to fight back alongside Jadeja but was removed by Chris Woakes as India were pushed to the verge of a loss. Jasprit Bumrah (5) was the ninth wicket to fall for India and Ben Stokes removed him with a short ball. Ravindra Jadeja (61 not out) tried his best to get India India over the line with Md Siraj but the later was eventually dismissed by Shoaib Bashir as India were all-out on 170 handing England 22 runs win.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "9:41 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T21:41:00", "topics": ["India cricket team", "England cricket team", "ICC World Test Championship", "Test Cricket", "India vs England"], "author": "Aditya Kaushik", "premium": "False"}

The new ball is also dew in 10 overs.", "content": "The post-lunch session saw England getting one wicket closer to victory with Jasprit Bumrah losing the wicket after entering the fray after lunch alongside Ravindra Jadeja with Team India continuing their resilient pursuit of chasing down the target. With Bumrah knowing full well that any mistake could possibly mean a defeat on the day, he lost patience and gave away his wicket to skipper Stokes in an attempt to pull the ball. After that it was Jadeja and Siraj who are fighting on for their side with Jadeja scoring another fifty for the visitors, his fourth in a row across the 3 Tests. The duo took India to 163/9 at the end of the session as India's hopes of a win is still alive. Surprisingly, Jasprit Bumrah's defence was on point across the majority of the session as him and Jadeja continued to rotate strike and put some crucial runs on the board. England did introduce spin in the session with Joe Root beginning his spell today. Shoaib Bashir, who got his hand injured earlier, also made his comeback and bowled a few overs. However, both batter stood their ground with the ball getting older and older, giving the visitors some relief. Jadeja remained hesitant in taking the singles and giving Bumrah the strike and was constantly looking for gaps in the field for him to get back to his crease after a couple of runs. Earlier, India’s batting lineup crumbled under relentless pressure from England’s fast bowlers, headed by Jofra Archer. Chris Woakes struck just before lunch, trapping Nitish Reddy caught behind and leaving India precariously positioned at 112 for 8 while chasing 193.

However, early dismissals of Rishabh Pant (9 off 12), KL Rahul (39 off 58), and Washington Sundar (0 off 4) within the opening hour effectively sealed India’s fate. Pant, nursing a wounded left index finger sustained from day one, struggled to cope with Archer’s fiery pace, wincing with each delivery that surged off the bowler's hand. Despite this, he managed a couple of elegant boundaries, a flick and a one-handed drivebefore Archer delivered a perfectly straightened delivery that shattered Pant’s off-stump. Archer then exchanged a heated word with Pant as he made the solemn walk back through the Long Room. Rahul briefly attempted to stabilize the innings, but was dismissed three overs later. England captain Ben Stokes delivered a seaming delivery that trapped Rahul lbw. Although the initial on-field decision went against Stokes’s appeal, the field umpire’s call was overturned via DRS, prompting cheers from the packed crowd. Even though it was a Monday, Lord’s was filled with Indian and English supporters lining up well ahead of the start. In the wake of Rahul’s dismissal, Jadeja and Reddy presented some resistance, but at 95/7 after the first hour, they still needed another 98 runs. Recognizing the pitch’s treachery, they adopted a defensive mindset. Amid it all, Stokes delivered an impressive nine-over spell, further asserting England’s dominance. With the odds heavily stacked, India's hopes of a dramatic turnaround appeared slim as the final session progressed.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "8:52 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T20:52:00", "topics": ["India vs England", "Test Cricket", "India cricket team", "England cricket team"], "author": "Shashwat Nishant", "premium": "False"}

The book titled 'Everything All at Once: India and the Six Simultaneous Global Transitions', co-authored by Kumar with Ishan Joshi, offers a timely and thought-provoking perspective on the seismic changes currently reshaping the world with a significant impact on India's future prospects. \"India's leadership has to mobilise all necessary talents and resources to design and implement a development strategy that innovatively responds to these multiple challenges and effectively exploits the opportunities that are inherent in the evolving trends for meeting our goals,\" the book says. Noting that never before in the history of global economic development did countries have to contend with such enormous challenges while pursuing their development agenda, the book says the long -term development goal for India must be to meet the exploding aspirations of its young population, which was braodly captured in the term Viksit Bharat propagated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \"The highest level of aspiration of Viksit Bharat would be to restore India's position in the world by 2050 - which would mark the centenary of India emerging as a sovereign republic - as it was prior to being colonised,\" it said. Explaining further, the book says this would imply increasing its share in the world economy from present 3 per cent to 18 per cent, which according to Angus Maddison was India's share in 1850. \"With the global GDP estimated to easily cross $200 trillion by 2050, India's GDP will have to be over $36 trillion from the present $3.8 trillion requiring an annual average growth rate of about 9 per cent over the next two-and -a half decades,\" it said. The book says six major global transitions are unfolding simultaneously-- geopolitical, geoeconomic, geographical, the rise of the South, climate change, and technology breakthroughs. These, simultaneously occurring transitions, present both challenges and historic opportunities for India, it added. The authors argue that 'chaos, contestation, and constant recalibration' of policy design will define the global landscape for the foreseeable future. It is within this context that the authors ask an urgent question: Where does this leave over 800 million young Indians with their burgeoning aspirations and diminishing certainties? And how will the policy response need to jettison the business as usual' approach to respond to these challenges and uncertainties, and achieve the national goal of becoming Viksit Bharat over the next 25 years, the book wonders. The book carefully analyses the nature of these six transitions and, on that basis, outlines a flexible policy approach that is rooted in India's ground realities. The authors argue that the government will have to adopt a self-designed policy framework if India is to successfully navigate these transitions and unlock its vast potential for simultaneously accelerating its economic growth, reducing its carbon footprint, and ensuring satisfactory living standards for its young population.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "8:51 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T20:51:00", "topics": ["Rajiv Kumar", "Niti Aayog", "economic growth"], "author": "Press Trust of India", "premium": "False"}

India lost Rishabh Pant (9), KL Rahul (39), and Washington Sundar (0) in quick succession during the first hour. Pant, battling a finger injury, was bowled by Jofra Archer after striking two crisp boundaries. Rahul fell lbw to Ben Stokes, with the DRS overturning the on-field decision. India collapsed to 112/8 when Nitish Reddy edged Woakes to the keeper just before lunch. Post-lunch, Jasprit Bumrah joined Ravindra Jadeja with India still over 80 runs adrift. The pair offered brief resistance, rotating strike smartly, and frustrating England. Bumrah, though largely solid in defense, fell attempting a pull shot off Stokes, leaving India 9 down. Jadeja stood firm, completing a fourth consecutive fifty in the series. He was joined by Mohammed Siraj as India reached 163/9 at tea.

Data from CoinMarketCap showed bitcoin climbed above $123,000 early Monday, up from about $108,000 only a week ago. The world's oldest and most popular cryptocurrency is currently the fifth most valuable asset class in the world at $2.4 trillion, giving it a higher market cap than Amazon. The enthusiasm for bitcoin comes as the US House is set to take up several pieces of cryptocurrency-related legislation in what's been dubbed crypto week in Congress. Lawmakers have been under pressure from President Donald Trump and the big-spending crypto lobby to pass legislation quickly. That includes a bill passed last month by the Senate that would regulate a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins. The House is also set to take up a cryptocurrency market structure legislation that is far more sweeping. Trump, once a sceptic of the industry, has vowed in his second term to make the US the global capital of crypto. Meanwhile, he and his family have moved aggressively into nearly every corner of the industry: mining operations, billion-dollar bitcoin purchases, a newly minted stablecoin and a Trump-branded meme coin. The crypto industry has rapidly become a major player in Washington after feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. The industry spent huge amounts on last year's elections and has been spending heavily on lobbying and other influence efforts this year. Bitcoin has seen a significant rebound since April, when it briefly dipped below $75,000. Spot bitcoin ETFs are becoming increasingly popular since launching last year and several publicly traded companies have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, bitcoin has taken a highly volatile path to mainstream acceptance. Its backers say the asset is like a digital gold that can act as a hedge against central bank and government malfeasance. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created.

Speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry’s (CII’s) GCC Business Summit, Thakur said strong physical and digital infrastructure, strategic interventions through the Digital India initiative, streamlined approval processes, and large talent strength have helped GCCs grow. “Whether we need to replicate these models or enhance them further is something we need to deliberate today.

The announcement came after the Mumbai-based pharma major inked a settlement pact with US-based Incyte Corporation regarding the hair loss drug. Incyte had earlier accused Sun Pharma of patent infringement. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties will seek dismissal of the pending Leqselvi litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Both companies will mutually release each other from all claims that were raised or could have been raised in that litigation. “Incyte has also granted Sun a limited and non-exclusive licence to US patent numbers 9,662,335 and certain other related patents with respect to oral deuruxolitinib for certain agreed-upon non-haematology-oncology indications including alopecia areata, in the US,” the company said in a regulatory filing on the exchanges.

Deuruxolitinib is expected to go off-patent in the financial year 2025–26 (FY26). The launch adds Leqselvi to Sun Pharma’s innovative therapies portfolio, which saw sales of $1,216 million in FY25, according to Sun Pharma’s investor presentation for the year. According to a Reuters report, Shrikant Akolkar, analyst at Nuvama Institutional Equities, said the drug could generate up to $400 million in sales by FY30, with peak sales potential of $900 million, and boost growth in Sun Pharma’s key US market. Commenting on the launch, Sun Pharma America CEO Richard Ascroft said the launch of Leqselvi in the US brings an effective, new treatment option for severe alopecia areata to eligible patients and the healthcare providers who treat them. “As a company committed to launching new therapeutic options which address the unmet needs of patients, adding Leqselvi to our dermatology portfolio represents a key milestone for the business and an important advancement for the alopecia areata community,” he added.

He wanted to win Wimbledon, of course, and it would have meant a lot to him no matter who the opponent was in the final. That this championship, his fourth at a Grand Slam tournament, came via a win over Carlos Alcaraz made it all the more significant to Sinner and to the future of their burgeoning rivalry, the best men's tennis has to offer these days and, perhaps, for many years to come. It is important, for sure, the No. 1-ranked Sinner said Sunday night after prevailing 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 against No. 2 Alcaraz, because when you lose several times against someone, it's not easy. Sinner had lost five matches in a row against Alcaraz, none more disheartening than the one they played last month in the French Open final. Sinner grabbed a two-set lead in that one, then held a trio of championship points, before losing in five sets after 5 hours, 29 minutes. I keep looking up to Carlos, because even today, I felt like he was doing couple of things better than I did, Sinner said. So that's something ... we will work on and prepare ourselves, because he's going to come for us again. Perhaps as soon as at the U.S. Open, which starts in New York on Aug. 24 and where Sinner is the defending champion. They will be seeded No. 1 and No. 2 again, so could only meet there in another final. Alcaraz won the trophy at Flushing Meadows in 2022, beginning a stretch in which he and Sinner have combined to win nine of the past 12 majors. That includes the last seven, leaving zero doubt that these two young guys Sinner is 23, Alcaraz is 22 have pushed themselves way past everyone else in the game at the moment. I'm just really, really happy about having this rivalry with him. It's great for us, and it is great for tennis. Every time we play against each other, our level is really high, Alcaraz said. We don't (see) a level like this, if I'm honest with you. I don't see any (other players) playing against each other (and) having the level that we are playing when we face each other. Both serve well, although Sinner was better at that Sunday. Both return well, although, again, Sinner was superior over these particular three hours. Both cover the court exceedingly well Alcaraz is faster; Sinner has a bigger reach and is a better slider. Both hit the ball so, so hard Alcaraz is more prone to the spectacular; Sinner is as pure and consistent a ball-striker as there is. And so on. One other contrast, usually, is that Alcaraz shows emotion, whether via yells of Vamos! or the sort of point-to-his-ear-then-pump-his-fist celebration he did after winning Sunday's opening set by stretching and reaching low for a cross-court backhand to close a 12-stroke point. Sinner is far more contained. Even his arm-raised victory poses are mild-mannered. Sunday, though, there were more visible displays. He even shouted Let's go! after one point. Later, he shook his racket overhead while the crowd roared after a well-struck backhand. When he took a set with a forehand winner, Sinner held a pose, then lifted a fist. When the match was over, he crouched, lowered his head and pounded his right palm on the grass five times. You saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments,\" said one of Sinner's coaches, Darren Cahill, \"and a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that, when he had his nose in front, that he kept on closing the door against Carlos. Both players spoke about their matchup motivating them to work hard to try to improve. It gives me the opportunity to just give my 100% every practice, every day. Just to be better, thanks to that, said Alcaraz, who won the past two Wimbledon titles and was 5-0 in Grand Slam finals before Sunday. The level that I have to maintain, and I have to raise, if I want to beat Jannik is really high. Sinner described Alcaraz as someone who is young, who wins basically everything.

In his opening remarks at the meeting, Jaishankar said the bilateral relations can develop in a \"positive trajectory\" on the foundation that differences should not become disputes and nor should competition become conflict, adding the ties can be built only on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity. The external affairs minister said India hopes \"zero tolerance for terrorism\" will be upheld at the upcoming meeting of the SCO, saying its primary mandate is to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism, comments seen as a reference to Pakistan's support to cross-border terrorism. Jaishankar met Wang hours after he landed in China on a two-day visit to attend a conclave of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). It is his first visit to the neighbouring country since bilateral ties witnessed a severe downturn following the Galwan Valley clashes in June 2020. The external affairs minister also held talks with Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and conveyed to him that continued normalisation of bilateral ties can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes. In the last nine months, India and China have been engaged in normalising their relations after ending the military face-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in October last year. Though the two sides disengaged troops from the friction points, they are yet to de-escalate the situation by pulling back the frontline forces from the border. Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the eastern Ladakh region. In his remarks at the meeting with Wang, Jaishankar also underlined the need to avoid \"restrictive\" trade measures and \"roadblocks\", in an apparent reference to Beijing's approach on export of critical minerals as well as issues relating to the supply of fertilisers. \"We have made good progress in the past nine months for the normalisation of our bilateral relations. It is a result of the resolution of friction along the border and our ability to maintain peace and tranquillity there,\" he said. \"This is the fundamental basis for mutual strategic trust and for smooth development of bilateral relations. It is now incumbent on us to address other aspects related to the border, including de-escalation,\" the external affairs minister said. Jaishankar also repeated New Delhi's consistent position that India-China ties should be based on \"mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity\". \"As neighbouring nations and major economies in the world today, there are various facets and dimensions of our ties. Measures towards normalising our people-to-people exchanges can certainly foster mutually beneficial cooperation,\" he said. \"It is also essential in this context that restrictive trade measures and roadblocks are avoided. I hope to discuss these issues in further detail.\" The external affairs minister noted that \"stable and constructive\" ties between India and China are not only to each other's benefit, but that of the world as well. \"This is best done by handling relations on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity.\" \"We have also earlier agreed that differences should not become disputes, nor should competition ever become conflict. On this foundation, we can now continue to develop our ties along a positive trajectory,\" he said. Jaishankar said the bilateral relationship requires both sides taking a \"far-seeing approach\" even as he referred to a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan in October last year. Since our leaders' meeting, the India-China relationship has been gradually moving in a positive direction, he said, adding \"our responsibility is to maintain that momentum.\" \"In recent times, the two of us have had several opportunities to meet at international events and carry out strategic communication. It is our expectation that this will now be regular and take place in each other's countries,\" Jaishankar added. The external affairs minister noted that the two sides have marked the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations and appreciated the resumption of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra after a gap of five years. The external affairs minister also wished the Chinese side a successful SCO presidency and that India is committed to ensuring \"good outcomes and decisions\". In his meeting with Zheng, Jaishankar said an open exchange of views between the two sides is \"very important\" considering the \"complex\" global scenario. Jaishankar travelled to China less than three weeks after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh visited the Chinese port city of Qingdao to participate in the SCO defence ministers' conference. The military standoff in eastern Ladakh began in May 2020, and a deadly clash at the Galwan Valley in June that year resulted in a severe strain in ties between the two neighbours. The face-off effectively ended following completion of the disengagement process from the last two friction points of Demchok and Depsang under an agreement finalised on October 21 last year. The decision to revive various dialogue mechanisms was taken at the meeting between Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi in Kazan. The Modi-Xi meeting came two days after India and China firmed up a disengagement pact for Depsang and Demchok.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "7:50 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T19:50:00", "topics": ["S Jaishankar", "Beijing", "China"], "author": "Press Trust of India", "premium": "False"}

This strong trajectory in the October-December 2024 quarter helped cushion a growing merchandise trade deficit. These are among the key findings of the third edition of ‘Trade Watch Quarterly’, released by NITI Aayog on Monday. Merchandise trade gap widens During the same period, India’s merchandise exports rose by 3 per cent to $108.7 billion, while imports jumped 6.5 per cent to $187.5 billion, the report found. The widening goods trade gap was offset significantly by robust services performance, reinforcing India’s growing competitiveness in the global services economy. Key trade highlights from Q3 FY25 The publication also highlighted key trends during this period: * Digitally Delivered Services (DDS) exports reached $269 billion in 2024, making India the world’s fifth-largest exporter in this segment. * Exports of aircraft, spacecraft and parts entered the top 10 export categories, growing by over 200 per cent year-on-year on increased demand from Saudi Arabia, UAE, and the Czech Republic. * High-tech merchandise exports, in electrical machinery and arms/ammunition, have grown at a 10.6 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2014, reaching $80.6 billion in 2024 India’s tariff advantage in US trade On trade with the United States, the NITI Aayog report noted that while the government was still engaged in bilateral talks with the Trump administration, India currently enjoys a tariff advantage over major competitors. This has been observed in key sectors like pharmaceuticals, textiles, and electrical machinery. “The realignment of global trade requires agile policymaking,” said Arvind Virmani, member of NITI Aayog. “India’s trade strategy is increasingly driven by competitiveness, innovation, and a focus on key global markets like the United States.” The report mentions that India is well-positioned to capitalise on the realignment. For example, India stands to gain a tariff edge over China, Mexico, and Canada in nuclear reactors, iron and steel, textiles, electricals and vehicles, the report said. Rise in Indian exports, FTA fuels growth Exports to ASEAN, West Africa, and South Asia saw significant year-on-year growth, with Singapore alone accounting for a 52 per cent rise, largely due to higher petroleum and cargo vessel shipments. Overall, North America and the EU continued to anchor 40 per cent of India’s exports. Trade with Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners also recorded robust growth. Exports to these countries rose 16 per cent year-on-year to $43.2 billion, while imports increased 7 per cent to $66.7 billion. Notably, Mauritius saw an 800 per cent surge in imports owing to offshore drilling platform purchases Future trade outlook for India To leverage trade tailwinds, the report recommended several policy actions, such as: * Expanding PLI schemes to labour-intensive sectors * Fast-tracking FTAs, especially with the EU and the US * Enhancing export credit access for MSMEs * Building digital-ready customs and trade infrastructure. The report also recommended negotiating services-oriented FTAs, particularly with the US, that would cover data flows and professional mobility.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "7:41 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T19:41:00", "topics": ["Niti Aayog Report", "merchandise trade", "India trade policy", "India trade"], "author": "Vasudha Mukherjee", "premium": "False"}

In a letter dated June 21, Union Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava said that India is witnessing a sharp rise in obesity among both adults and children which significantly raises the risk of non-communicable diseases, affects mental health, mobility and quality of life, and imposes a heavy economic burden through increased healthcare care costs and productivity losses. Early prevention and health promotion are critical to reversing these trends. \"At the opening ceremony of the 38th National Games in Dehradun on 28 January 2025, the prime minister invoked the Fit India Campaign and urged citizens to adopt active, healthy lifestyles as part of the broader vision of Swastha Bharat.

In response to this national appeal, and as part of the ministry's flagship initiatives under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD), it is imperative to promote sustainable behavioural changes at our workplaces. These include reducing excessive consumption of oil and sugar, both of which are key contributors to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other lifestyle-related disorders, Srivastava stated. \"We are proposing the display of 'Sugar and Oil Boards' initiative to promote healthier dietary habits in various settings.

These include shoppable advertisements for connected televisions (CTV) and shoppable mastheads for mobile devices. Launched in India at the end of May, the shoppable CTV ads allow viewers to explore and interact with products directly on the big screen using QR codes and send-to-phone options. On mobile, YouTube’s masthead—its most prominent ad placement—now features a shopping component, enabling brands to highlight new product launches and drive engagement during key moments. This follows YouTube being the most-watched streaming service on CTV in India for the last 12 months, said Roma Datta Chobey, Managing Director, Digital First Businesses, Google India, in a virtual media roundtable. Additionally, 87 per cent of Indian consumers watch YouTube or YouTube Shorts as part of their shopping journey. She noted that the country’s booming digital presence and large user base have given Google an opportunity to introduce more innovative features to this segment. “Consumers are searching, streaming, scrolling, and shopping at the same time in many new ways. In today's unpredictable consumer journeys, what truly matters is how brands show up in key moments, and that's where our partnership (with advertisers and marketers) becomes more crucial than ever. While many platforms can offer reach, only Google and YouTube can help brands be present across all four of these behaviours,” Chobey added. Dan Taylor, Vice President, Global Ads, Google, said the company will continue to invest in new ways to help advertisers. Later this year, Google plans to bring another feature, ads in AI (artificial intelligence) overviews, to India. This will be available for mobile and desktop mediums in English. Through this, search and shopping ads will appear directly within AI overviews when relevant to both the query and the response provided. “In India, 80 per cent of Gen Z rely on Google search for shopping, discovery, research, and decision-making.

The experiment, part of Axiom Space's outreach and scientific mission, highlighted the unique behaviour of water in space. After an 18-day stay at the ISS, Shukla and three others -- commander Peggy Whitson and mission specialists Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski of Poland and Tibor Kapu of Hungary -- of the commercial Axiom-4 mission set off on a return journey to Earth on Monday evening. Using surface tension to their advantage, Shukla formed a floating water bubble. I've become a water bender here in the station, he joked. Another astronaut Whitson further went on to press a plastic bag gently into the sphere, demonstrating how surface tension behaves like a magnet in microgravity by clinging to the object and distorting light like a lens. The astronauts also spoke about the opportunity not just to engage in science but also to communicate the wonder and beauty of Earth from space. I try to savour every moment I get -- just sitting by the window and looking down. It's the most beautiful view I've seen, Shukla said onboard the ISS. Whitson explained that the crew is nearing the end of their two-week mission, during which they've balanced rigorous scientific research with education and public engagement. Their mission has also included outreach to students and STEM communities around the globe, including in India, Hungary, and Poland. Asked about re-entering Earth's gravity, Whitson was frank: From me having experienced it, I know first person -- it sucks. Gravity really does. Shukla, on his maiden spaceflight, said he hopes to handle the descent better than his ascent, which involved some space motion sickness. In the 10 minutes of their broadcast, the astronauts estimated they had travelled about 2,900 miles. The Axiom-4 mission began its space odyssey on June 25 when the Falcon-9 rocket carrying the Dragon space capsule blasted off from Florida towards the ISS.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "7:07 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T19:07:00", "topics": ["NASA", "International Space Stations", "space"], "author": "Press Trust of India", "premium": "False"}

Alopecia areata is a condition in which the immune system attacks hair follicles, leading to hair loss on the scalp as well as other parts of the body. “Leqselvi is an important step forward for people living with severe alopecia areata,” said Richard Ascroft, CEO of Sun Pharma North America. 8 mg Leqselvi tablets for severe alopecia areata is now available by prescription across the US. The delay in Sun Pharma's launch of Leqselvi in the US was caused by a patent infringement case, which was later settled in a US court with Incyte Corp, as reported by Reuters. The drug underwent two clinical trials, THRIVE-AA1 and THRIVE-AA2, involving 1,223 adults between 18 and 65 years of age. The trials were conducted in the US, Canada, and Europe. Hair regrowth was measured over a period of 24 weeks using a scoring system known as the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT), according to the company's statement. Shrikant Akolkar, analyst at Nuvama Institutional Equities, said the drug could generate up to $400 million in sales by FY30, with peak sales potential of $900 million, and boost growth in Sun's key US market, according to Reuters. The National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF) welcomed the launch. Its President, Nicole Friedland, said the new treatment offers hope to many people dealing with the emotional and social impacts of hair loss. Sun Pharmaceutical is also offering a 'Leqselvi Support Program' to help patients access the medicine. Eligible patients may be able to receive the drug for as little as $0 for up to two years. The program also includes personal guidance and support throughout the treatment process. “The clinical evidence for Leqselvi is truly compelling, demonstrating consistent efficacy,\" said Arash Mostaghimi, Vice Chair of Clinical Trials and Innovation and Associate Professor of Dermatology at Brigham and Women's Hospital. However, Leqselvi does carry certain risks. It may cause side effects such as infections, acne, headaches, or more serious health issues. Doctors are advised to screen patients thoroughly before and during treatment. Alopecia areata affects nearly 2.5 per cent of people in the United States during their lifetime. According to figures cited in the company’s release, the condition also affects a similar percentage of the global population. The scalp is the most commonly affected area, but hair loss can also occur on other parts of the body.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "7:00 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T19:00:00", "topics": ["Sun Pharma", "Fosun Pharmaceutical", "Drug", "US", "BS Web Reports"], "author": "Saurabh Thakur", "premium": "False"}

Spot gold was up 0.4 per cent at $3,367.51 per ounce, as of 0957 GMT, after hitting its highest level since June 23 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures rose 0.5 per cent to $3,379.30. Trump said on Saturday he would impose a 30 per cent tariff on most imports from the EU and Mexico from August 1, adding to similar warnings for other countries. Both the European Union and Mexico described the tariffs as unfair and disruptive, while the EU said it would extend its suspension of countermeasures to U.S. tariffs until early August and continue to press for a negotiated settlement. \"Trump tariffs threats are supporting demand for safe haven assets, and gold is a main beneficiary of that,\" said UBS commodity analyst Giovanni Staunovo. On the data front, traders await U.S. consumer price index data and the producer price index this week for cues on the Federal Reserve's interest rate path. Investors are currently anticipating 50 basis points worth of Fed rate cuts by the end of this year, starting in October. Gold tends to thrive in a low-rate environment. Meanwhile, Indian investors, traditionally obsessed with stockpiling gold, are increasingly turning to silver, as its returns this year outpaced those of gold. Spot silver was up 1.7 per cent at $39.02 per ounce, after hitting its highest level since September 2011 earlier in the session. The silver rally \"is driven by speculative flows, with the metal moving above technical resistance levels,\" Staunovo said. ANZ, in a note, said that silver breaking the $35-$37 range could potentially trigger new technical buying and drive prices toward $40. Platinum was down 1.2 per cent at $1,382.72.

The survey, conducted across 60 districts and 15 states, found that nearly 9.1 million animal bites occur each year, with children under 14 and the elderly most frequently affected. Even though 80 per cent of dog bite victims received at least one dose of the anti-rabies vaccine, the report raises alarm over the lack of access to complete post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), especially rabies immunoglobulin (RIG), which can be life-saving in severe exposures. What is rabies? Rabies is a lethal viral infection that attacks the central nervous system and is nearly always fatal once symptoms appear. Dogs are responsible for most human cases. After exposure, whether a bite or a minor scratch, a medical emergency emerges. Rabies remains lethal and severely underreported: ICMR The ICMR study, which used household-level data, estimates that 5,726 human rabies deaths occur in India every year. The highest incidence of dog bites was found among: Children aged 0–14 years Elderly above 60 years Males Despite India’s ambitious goal to eliminate rabies by 2030 under the National Action Plan for Rabies Elimination (NAPRE), these findings expose serious gaps in access, awareness, and post-bite care. Rabies immunoglobulin is the missing link: ICMR While vaccines are widely promoted, RIG remains severely underused and unavailable, particularly in public health settings. The ICMR study found that most dog bite victims received incomplete treatment, and few received RIG—a crucial biological that offers immediate protection before the vaccine takes effect. Experts emphasise that without RIG, even vaccinated individuals can succumb to rabies, especially in deep bite wounds or Category III exposures. While rabies vaccine is available for free of cost at most government hospitals and urban primary health centres (UPHCs), RIG is usually available only in tertiary care government hospitals, such as Aiims, Delhi, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi, Sion Hospital (Lokmanya Tilak), Mumbai, CMC Vellore, Tamil Nadu, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Chennai. How vaccine and RIG work together Rabies vaccine contains inactivated virus that prompts your immune system to develop protective antibodies. It is part of two protocols: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): for high-risk individuals (such as veterinarians and travellers to high-risk areas) Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): for those bitten or scratched, delivered on Days 0, 3, 7, and 14 (plus Day 28 for immunocompromised individuals) However, it requires about 7–14 days to build immunity, leaving a dangerous window if not supplemented. Rabies immunoglobulin provides immediate, passive immunity by introducing ready-made antibodies directly to the wound site. It is essential for Category III exposures—deep bites or contact with mucous membranes—as recommended by the World Health Organisation and other health experts. According to experts, RIG should be administered within seven days of the first vaccine dose. Without RIG, the rabies virus might reach the central nervous system before the vaccine can fully protect you—an almost certain path to fatality if the infection takes hold. Current government response The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), along with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), is implementing the National Rabies Control Programme (NRCP) to address these challenges through: Free provision of anti-rabies vaccine and RIG Mass dog vaccination campaigns Model anti-rabies clinics Awareness and training programmes Intersectoral coordination under a “One Health” approach However, according to the Marching Towards Rabies-Free India report by MoHFW, availability of RIG still varies drastically between states, and only 20 states have declared human rabies a notifiable disease, leading to chronic underreporting and delayed interventions. According to ICMR, rabies is 100 per cent fatal once symptoms begin—but also 100 per cent preventable with timely and complete treatment. Vaccination alone is not enough in severe cases and RIG must be administered within seven days of the first vaccine dose. According to MoHFW, the first line of defence is always immediate wound washing, followed by full PEP. Despite targets, India’s rabies strategy faces major barriers Uneven access to vaccine and immunoglobulin Weak surveillance and underreporting Lack of lab-confirmed diagnoses Public misconceptions about treatment Fragmented coordination across health sectors What are the common signs a dog may have rabies? Sudden, unprovoked aggression Attacking people or animals without reason Restlessness, snapping, biting at objects or air Excessive salivation or foaming at the mouth (due to paralysis of the jaw and throat muscles) Thick, sticky saliva may drip constantly Unusual behaviour or personality changes Friendly dogs becoming hostile Active dogs becoming lethargic or withdrawn Difficulty swallowing or hydrophobia (fear of water) Dogs may refuse to drink despite appearing thirsty Attempts to drink may trigger spasms or panic Staggering or paralysis Hind leg weakness Seizures or paralysis, especially near the end stage High-pitched growling or strange vocalisations Bark may sound distorted or unusual Whining, howling, or guttural noises Steps to take after a dog bite Immediate wound care Gently wash the affected area with soap and running water for at least 15 minutes, then sanitise with an iodine or 70 per cent alcohol solution. Seek medical attention Go to the nearest large government hospital or a known tertiary medical college hospital. Health professionals will classify the injury. There are three WHO-defined categories of rabies exposure: Category I (Touching or feeding animals, or being licked on intact skin): No PEP required, but wash hands for hygiene and observe the animal. Category II (Minor scratches or nibbles): Vaccine is required. Category III (Deep wounds or mucosal exposure): Both vaccine and RIG are required. For RIG, specifically ask if it’s available at the anti-rabies clinic or emergency room you visited. According to ICMR, MoHFW, and global medical experts, when it comes to rabies, it’s always better to act fast than to take chances—because once symptoms appear, it’s already too late.

The duo has quietly taken the Indian total above 100 and is slowly crawling towards the 193-run target. However, the tension of the match situation is catching up to the players, who are exchanging words after almost every over. One of the most heated moments of the day came in the 35th over, bowled by Brydon Carse, where Jadeja, on the last ball, played the ball to backward point and went for a double. However, while Jadeja was trying to reach the bowling end to complete the second run, he collided with Brydon Carse mid-pitch, as it looked like the Englishman pulled Jadeja back by his shoulders. The Indian all-rounder handled the situation in a calm manner and first completed the two runs before even reacting. After completing the double, Jadeja walked up to Carse, telling him that the collision was intentional as he was looking towards the ball. The whole English team stepped up to stop the situation from escalating as Carse continued to point fingers at Jadeja in an animated manner as the over came to an end. English pacers put India on verge of loss The final day of the third Test at Lord’s began with high tension and ended with England firmly in control as India crumbled under pressure in their chase of 193. The morning session belonged entirely to the hosts, who struck early and often to leave India reeling at 112 for 8 at lunch, still needing 81 runs for what now looks like an improbable victory. India’s hopes took a massive hit in the opening minutes as Rishabh Pant, battling a finger injury, was bowled by Jofra Archer with a delivery that sneaked through his defenses. Pant had looked to inject some momentum with a few boundaries, but his discomfort was evident and ultimately proved costly. The bigger blow, however, came when KL Rahul, India’s most experienced batter in the middle, was dismissed by Ben Stokes. A perfectly executed delivery from the England skipper drew an edge and sent Rahul back to the pavilion, further tilting the game in the hosts’ favor. Archer and Stokes bowled with relentless discipline, exploiting the unpredictable pitch and forcing mistakes from the Indian batters. Archer’s brilliance continued as he removed Washington Sundar for a duck with a sharp return catch, leaving India in deep trouble. Ravindra Jadeja and Nitish Kumar Reddy tried to stem the collapse and showed brief resistance amid a barrage of short-pitched bowling and verbal taunts from the English players. However, just before the lunch break, Reddy edged one from Chris Woakes to Jamie Smith, bringing another session to a dismal close for the visitors. At lunch, Jadeja remains unbeaten on 17, but with only the tail left for support, India’s chances are slim. England, on the other hand, will return after the break sensing a quick finish and a 2-1 lead in the series.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "5:36 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T17:36:00", "topics": ["India cricket team", "England cricket team", "ICC World Test Championship", "Test Cricket", "Ravindra Jadeja"], "author": "Aditya Kaushik", "premium": "False"}

According to a report by 9To5Google, Apple may be turning the “e” line of iPhones into an annual release cycle. The company is reportedly already developing the “iPhone 17e,” with a spring 2026 launch window in sight. Although the iPhone 16e was not Apple’s first attempt at offering a more affordable iPhone, it marked a shift by replacing the SE series and integrating a lower-cost option directly into the numbered iPhone lineup. Apple has long experimented with entry-level iPhones, beginning with the iPhone 5c in 2013 and followed by several SE models. However, none of these lines have seen regular, yearly updates. With the iPhone 17e reportedly in the works, that may finally be changing. iPhone 17e: What to expect The iPhone 17e is expected to feature a notable performance boost. As per the report, it could move from the A18 chip used in the iPhone 16e to the yet-to-be-announced A19 chip, which is likely to make its debut with the flagship iPhone 17 series later in 2025. Another significant update may come in the form of connectivity. The iPhone 17e is said to be the first model that could ship with Apple’s next-generation in-house modem, dubbed the C2. This would be the successor to Apple’s first custom modem chip. However, the report cautions that production delays could push the C2’s debut to the iPhone 18 lineup in late 2026.

The company is expected to host its Made by Google 2025 event next month, where it will likely introduce the Pixel 10 series, including the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and updated wearables like the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a. Made By Google 2025: Expected schedule Last year, Google moved its Pixel launch timeline from October to August, revealing devices earlier than usual. A similar schedule is expected this year, with the Made by Google 2025 event likely to take place in the second week of August. For context, the 2024 edition was held on August 13. According to 9to5Google, the Pixel 10 lineup could be unveiled by mid-August, with deliveries potentially starting around August 20. Made By Google 2025: Pixel 10 series, Pixel Watch 4, Buds 2a expected Pixel 10 series: The anticipated Google Pixel 10 series is expected to encompass four models: Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Google is unlikely to introduce a major design overhaul this year, instead opting for subtle refinements. However, notable changes are expected in the camera department, particularly for the base model. The standard Pixel 10 may adopt the same main and ultra-wide camera sensors seen in the Pixel 9a, which would represent a downgrade compared to the Pixel 9. It might compensate for this by adding a telephoto lens with 5x periscope-style optical zoom, similar to the one found on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to retain their current camera systems, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may also switch to the Pixel 9a’s primary sensor, replacing the higher-resolution sensor previously used in the foldable model. All four devices are expected to run on Google’s upcoming Tensor G5 chipset and boot Android 16 out of the box. Last year, Pixel 9 launched with Android 14 even though Android 15 was already in preview. Google is likely to change that this year as Android 16 is already rolling out to eligible Pixel devices. Additionally, the Pro models may support the Qi2 wireless charging standard. Alongside the Pixel 10 series smartphones, Google is anticipated to launch wearable devices including the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a. Pixel Watch 4: Details on the Pixel Watch 4 remain limited, but TechRadar recently reported that it will be available in 41mm and 45mm sizes, similar to the previous generation. It may also be offered in new colour variants, including: Silver/Porcelain Silver/Iris Gray/Moonstone Black/Obsidian Gold/Lemon Pixel Buds 2a: Google is also expected to refresh its Pixel Buds A-series lineup with a new model, likely called Pixel Buds 2a. These earbuds are tipped to include updated audio drivers for improved sound quality and new colour options like: Hazel Strawberry Iris Fog Light Made By Google 2025: Expected pricing of Pixel 10 series According to a recent 9to5Google report, pricing for the Pixel 10 lineup will largely mirror last year’s Pixel 9 series. Here’s a look at the anticipated European pricing: Pixel 10: €899 (128GB) Pixel 10 Pro: €1,099 (128GB) Pixel 10 Pro XL: €1,299 (256GB) Pixel 10 Pro Fold: €1,899 (256GB) As for accessories, the Pixel Buds 2a are expected to be priced at €149, up from €109 for the original Pixel Buds A-Series.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "3:56 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T15:56:00", "topics": ["Google Pixel", "Foldable devices", "Samsung Galaxy"], "author": "Harsh Shivam", "premium": "False"}

This action comes after the Department found several bogus bills claimed by several intermediaries under 80GGC,” ANI posted on its X handle. Calculate Income Tax: Income Tax Calculator Tool “Searches were also underway in connection with bogus medical expenses and tuition fees. Raids were underway on more than 200 locations,” ANI reported, quoting sources. Misuse of paperless filing flagged Authorities pointed out that the shift to paperless filing of income tax returns has made it easier for some taxpayers to inflate deductions, assuming they would escape scrutiny. However, recent initiatives such as the I-T Department’s “NUDGE” campaign flagged suspicious claims and encouraged taxpayers to revise their returns before facing penalties. Why political donations are under scrutiny Tax deductions for political donations, allowed under Section 80GGC of the Income Tax Act, are a key focus. These deductions enable individuals to reduce their taxable income if contributions are made to registered political parties or electoral trusts. “The Income Tax Department flags political donations to ensure transparency and prevent misuse of tax benefits,” said SR Patnaik, partner (head – taxation), Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. “Taxpayers are required to submit valid proofs of payments and receipts to substantiate donations. In case of unsubstantiated claims, it may lead to further scrutiny and penalties.” Should you rely on AI tools? The department’s recently launched TaxAssist AI tool has also been in focus, but experts caution against over-relying on it. “The tool is new and its performance hasn’t been tested extensively. Taxpayers may still need to consult a professional, especially in complex cases.” said Patnaik What should taxpayers do? Experts suggest to- Maintain proper records: Bank statements, transaction proofs, and receipts are critical. Avoid cash contributions: Only digital or banking channels qualify for deductions. Be cautious of intermediaries: Don’t engage agents who offer to ‘arrange’ deductions. Respond to notices promptly: Use TaxAssist for guidance, but seek professional advice if needed.

Rupee traded weak as the dollar index showed recovery, rising towards the 98 mark from recent lows of 96.50 over the past week, according to Jateen Trivedi, VP research analyst - commodity and currency at LKP Securities.

In May, the retail inflation rate stood at a 75-month low of 2.82 per cent, while in June last year, it was 5.08 per cent. Earlier in the day, the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation dipped to -0.13 per cent in June, from 0.39 per cent in May, marking the first negative reading since the beginning of the year. The drop was largely driven by deflationary trends in food articles, fuel and power, and basic metals.

China plus one has been reinvigorated after a hiatus of 2 years. Almost all top retailers have targets of diversifying at least 15-20 per cent out of China within next 2-3 years if India / Others can deliver. Faze Three in FY25 investor presentation said that the company estimates revenue growth of at least 22-25 per cent for FY 26 and FY 27 given the build up and efforts undertaken over the last 2 years to expand product categories and growth across existing customers & categories while adding new customers too.

Dubbed Endometriosis Multidisciplinary Care Model (EndoCare India), the initiative aims to deliver coordinated, patient-centred care for conditions such as endometriosis, fibroids, PCOS, and chronic pelvic pain, The New Indian Express reported. The model will integrate care from gynaecologists, anaesthesiologists, surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, mental health professionals, physiotherapists, nutritionists, and social workers. Diagnosis delays prompt a new approach According to a 2022 study published in the American Journal of Reproductive Immunology, endometriosis affects around 42 million Indian women. Yet, the condition is often diagnosed 7–10 years after initial symptoms such as pelvic pain, fatigue, and infertility appear—many of which are misdiagnosed or dismissed. The new model is a response to these widespread delays and aims to provide early intervention and comprehensive care. Built on India’s first national endometriosis study The model is grounded in findings from India’s first national study on endometriosis - The Endometriosis Clinical and Genetic Research in India (ECGRI). This five-year study examined the clinical, epidemiological, environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with different subtypes of endometriosis in Indian women. Conducted across 18 sites in nine states—including Kerala, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka—the study included two groups: one diagnosed with endometriosis and another without. The study revealed: 37 per cent of participants experienced symptoms during adolescence; 77 per cent before age 30 Most commonly reported symptoms: pelvic pain (73 per cent) and infertility (46 per cent) Over 50 per cent had other gynaecological disorders; 18.6 per cent had autoimmune conditions 13.5 per cent had musculoskeletal issues 11.6 per cent experienced psychiatric conditions such as anxiety or depression Underweight women were at higher risk of developing the condition Researchers also found strong links between endometriosis and menstrual irregularities, such as heavy bleeding, shorter cycle lengths, and prior hormonal treatments. Multidisciplinary teams for holistic care Under EndoCare India, patients will be assessed and treated by an integrated team rather than individual specialists. Depending on the diagnosis, the care team may include: Gynaecologists for primary diagnosis and reproductive care Psychologists/psychiatrists for mental health support Physiotherapists to manage chronic pain Surgeons for operative treatments Nutritionists and social workers for holistic patient support This collaborative approach aims to reduce misdiagnosis, enable timely interventions, and offer more empathetic, long-term treatment plans. Training, awareness, and access at the core The model also places strong emphasis on public awareness, training medical professionals, and expanding access to specialised gynaecological care—especially for conditions that have long been neglected in public discourse. Dr Rahul Gajbhiye, Deputy Director at ICMR-NIRRCH, who led the national study, told The New Indian Express that the model was designed to meet the medical, psychological, and social needs of women across life stages. “This integrated model focuses on delivering coordinated, holistic care within the public healthcare system,” he said. A potential blueprint for global menstrual health reforms The move aligns with international efforts to improve menstrual and reproductive health and may serve as a policy blueprint for other developing nations seeking to strengthen women’s healthcare systems.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "3:42 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T15:42:00", "topics": ["Health with BS", "ICMR", "HealthKart", "Women health in India"], "author": "Sarjna Rai", "premium": "False"}

The Aayog in its third edition of 'Trade Watch Quarterly', said there will be significant opportunities for India in the US markets both in terms of the number of products and volume of the US market. \"India is expected to gain competitiveness in 22 out of the top 30 categories (HS 2 level), representing a market size of $2,285.2 billion,\" the Aayog said. It further explained that China, Canada, and Mexico are the leading exporters to the US in these categories, therefore higher tariffs on these countries at 30 per cent, 35 per cent, and 25 per cent, respectively, will enhance India's competitiveness. The Aayog said India's competitiveness will remain unchanged in 6 out of 30 categories, amounting for 32.8 per cent exports to the US and 26 per cent of the US total imports, amounting to $26.5 billion. While for six product categories at HS 2 level, India faces a higher average tariff(between 1-3 per cent) which can be negotiated with the US, the Aayog said, \"In 78 products, accounting for 52 per cent of India's exports and 26 per cent share in total US imports, India is expected to gain competitiveness.\" For 17 products (accounting for 28 per cent of India's export to the US) out of the top 100 products at the HS-4 level, the Aayog said India's competitiveness remains unchanged due to no change in tariff differential. The Aayog also pointed out that \"India stands to gain in sectors with high tariff gaps vs China, Canada and Mexico -- minerals and fuels, apparel, electronics, plastics, furniture, and seafoods in a $1,265-billion market\". Meanwhile, an Indian commerce ministry team has reached Washington for another round of talks on the proposed bilateral trade agreement (BTA), which will begin on Monday. Chief negotiator of India and special secretary in the department of commerce Rajesh Agrawal will join the team on Wednesday. The four-day talks will end on Thursday. India's deputy chief negotiator for the proposed BTA has reached Washington for the talks on the first phase of the BTA, the official said. The visit assumes significance as both sides have to iron out issues in sectors like agriculture and automobiles. It is also important as the US has further postponed the imposition of additional tariffs on several countries, including India, until August 1. Earlier this month, the Indian team was in Washington for talks, with negotiations taking place from June 26 to July 2. The team has once again reached the US for negotiations. India has hardened its position on the US demand for duty concessions on agri and dairy products. New Delhi has, so far, not given any duty concessions to any of its trading partners in a free trade agreement in the dairy sector. India is seeking the removal of this additional tariff (26 per cent). It is also seeking the easing of tariffs on steel and aluminium (50 per cent) and the auto (25 per cent) sectors. Against these, India has reserved its right under the WTO (World Trade Organization) norms to impose retaliatory duties. US President Donald Trump announced heavy tariffs on a number of countries, including India, on April 2. However, it was soon postponed for 90 days until July 9 and later to August 1. From July 7, the Trump administration has issued tariff letters to a number of its trading partners, including Bangladesh, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, South Africa, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Laos, Serbia, and Tunisia. The US wants duty concessions on certain industrial goods, automobiles, especially electric vehicles, wines, petrochemical products, and agri goods, like dairy items, apples, tree nuts, and genetically modified crops. On the other hand, India is seeking duty concessions for labour-intensive sectors, such as textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, grapes, and bananas in the proposed trade pact. The two countries are looking to conclude talks for the first tranche of the proposed bilateral trade agreement (BTA) by fall (September-October) this year. Before that, they are looking for an interim trade pact. India's merchandise exports to the US rose 21.78 per cent to $17.25 billion in April-May this fiscal year, while imports rose 25.8 per cent to $8.87 billion.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "3:37 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T15:37:00", "topics": ["Donald Trump", "Trade exports", "Trump tariffs", "Niti Aayog"], "author": "Press Trust of India", "premium": "False"}

The directive issued by Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh applies to the area inside and along the main ring road that encircles the centre of Hanoi. The local government has been tasked with phasing out the two-wheelers by the deadline. Like the rest of Vietnam, motorcycles are the main mode of transport for most of Hanoi's 8 million residents. The city has nearly 7 million motorcycles and just over a million cars. But as incomes rise and more people switch to private vehicles, air pollution from traffic has become a growing concern. Hanoi is often enveloped in thick smog, ranking among the most polluted cities worldwide. Vietnam also wants to switch from fossil-fuel to electric vehicles to cut pollution and tackle climate change. Local EV maker VinFast is leading the shift by holding nearly a fifth of the market share, according to the European Chamber of Commerce. But it still has only a small share of the two-wheeler market. But many are concerned about the unclear plan for phasing out the vehicles. Nguyen Van Hung, 62, has spent three decades driving a motorcycle taxi in Hanoi, now working with Grab, a ride-hailing app widely used across Southeast Asia. He worries the ban will hit the working class hardest. It will affect people who rely on motorbikes to earn a living, he said, pointing to delivery drivers, commuters and ride-hailing services. How can people just discard their vehicles? Others said that the timeline was unrealistic. Hoang Duy Dung, 32, an office clerk who works in the city centre, said he supports cleaner air but believes it is too soon. We need better public transport and more support before such a big change. Central Hanoi is home to much of the city's business activity, including offices, government buildings and commercial hubs. A second phase, set to begin in January 2028, will expand the ban to a wider area and include all fossil-fuel two-wheelers, while also restricting some gasoline-powered cars. Other measures include upgrading waste-treatment plants, using digital tools to monitor pollution and introducing stricter penalties for violators.

The brokerage initiated coverage on Landmark Cars with a 'Buy' rating and a target price of ₹820 per share, implying a 60 per cent upside from Friday's closing levels. At 3 PM, the stock was trading at ₹531, up 4.5 per cent from its previous day's close of ₹507.85. In comparison, the benchmark NSE Nifty50 was trading lower by 73.55 points or 0.3 per cent at 25,080.3 levels. According to analysts at B& Securities, while Landmark Cars' proforma and reported revenues grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, from FY23 to FY25, the company's Ebitda, PBT, and PAT declined by 3 per cent, 20 per cent, and 55 per cent, respectively. However, the company's sales growth of 11 per cent was double the Indian passenger vehicle sales CAGR of 5 per cent over FY23 to FY25. During FY25, the older outlets and workshops contributed ₹70 crore to PBT, and the newly opened ones incurred PBT-level losses of ₹40 crore. As these facilities ramp up, they are expected to break even starting Q1FY26, with most turning profitable by the end of FY26, the brokerage said. The company has also tied up with three new brands - Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Kia and MG Motors - over the past two years. Landmark Cars is the first multi-brand, multi-location auto dealer operating in the premium and luxury car segment in India with 70 showrooms and 61 workshops as of FY25. \"While the after-sales mix for old brands is 17 per cent for the new brands, it is 9 per cent.

The fiery India pacer has been handed a fine amounting to 15 per cent of his match fee and received one demerit point for breaching the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) Code of Conduct. The incident occurred during a tense session of play that saw 14 wickets fall in a single day, with Siraj right in the thick of the action. Siraj, who has picked up four wickets in the match so far, celebrated Duckett’s wicket with visible aggression—a moment that may have lifted the energy on the field but crossed the line in the eyes of match officials. As per the ICC, the fast bowler’s behaviour breached Article 2.5 of its Code of Conduct, which deals with actions that could provoke or antagonise a dismissed batter. ICC pulls up Siraj for ‘provocative conduct’ According to the ICC’s statement, Siraj’s send-off included walking aggressively towards Duckett after taking the wicket and making physical contact as the English batter began his walk back. The governing body noted that this conduct was deemed inappropriate and a Level 1 offence under its disciplinary framework. A match official stated in the report that Siraj’s celebration could have escalated tensions had it not been quickly controlled. Although no formal hearing was necessary—with Siraj admitting the offence and accepting the sanction proposed by match referee Richie Richardson—the demerit point adds to his previous record. He now has two demerit points in a 24-month period. What this means for Siraj While the sanction is relatively minor, it does bring Siraj closer to potential suspension territory. If a player accumulates four demerit points within two years, they are converted into suspension points, which could lead to a ban for one or more matches. Despite the reprimand, Siraj remained crucial to India’s dominance at Lord’s. Shortly after Duckett’s dismissal, he removed Ollie Pope for just four, helping India reduce England to 42 for two in their second innings.

France is celebrating its biggest holiday Monday with 7,000 people marching, on horseback or riding armoured vehicles along the cobblestones of the Champs-Elysees, the most iconic avenue in Paris. And there are plans for partying and pageantry around the country. Why Bastille Day is a big deal Parisians stormed the Bastille fortress and prison on July 14, 1789, a spark for the French Revolution that overthrew the monarchy. In the ensuing two centuries, France saw Napoleon's empire rise and fall, more uprisings and two world wars before settling into today's Fifth Republic, established in 1958. Bastille Day has become a central moment for modern France, celebrating democratic freedoms and national pride, a melange of revolutionary spirit and military prowess. The Paris parade beneath the Arc de Triomphe so impressed visiting US President Donald Trump in 2017 that it inspired him to stage his own parade this year. What to watch for The spectacle begins on the ground, with French President Emmanuel Macron reviewing the troops and relighting the eternal flame beneath the Arc de Triomphe. Each parade uniform has a touch of symbolism. The contingent from the French Foreign Legion is eye-catching, its bearded troops wearing leather aprons and carrying axes, a reference to their original role as route clearers for advancing armies. The Paris event includes flyovers by fighter jets, trailing red, white and blue smoke. Then the evening sees a drone light show and fireworks at the Eiffel Tower that has gotten more elaborate every year. What's special about this year Every year, France hosts a special guest for Bastille Day, and this year it's Indonesia, with President Prabowo Subianto representing the world's biggest Muslim country, which also a major Asian economic and military player. Indonesian troops, including 200 drummers, are marching in Monday's parade, and Indonesia is expected to confirm new purchases of Rafale fighter jets and other French military equipment during the visit. Prabowo, who was accused of rights abuses under Indonesia's prior dictatorship, will be treated to a special holiday dinner at the Elysee Palace. Finnish troops serving in the UN force in Lebanon and Belgian and Luxembourg troops serving in a NATO force in Romania will also parade through Paris, reflecting the increasingly international nature of the event. Among the dignitaries invited to watch will be Fousseynou Samba Cisse, who rescued two babies from a burning apartment earlier this month and received a last-minute invitation in a phone call from Macron himself. What's the geopolitical backdrop Beyond the military spectacle in Paris are growing concerns about an uncertain world. On the eve Bastille Day, Macron announced 6.5 billion euros ($ 7.6 billion) in extra French military spending in the next two years because of new threats ranging from Russia to terrorism and online attacks. The French leader called for intensified efforts to protect Europe and support for Ukraine. \"Since 1945, our freedom has never been so threatened, and never so seriously,\" Macron said. \"We are experiencing a return to the fact of a nuclear threat, and a proliferation of major conflicts.\" What else happens on Bastille Day It's a period when France bestows special awards including the most prestigious, the Legion of Honour on notable people. This year's recipients include Gisele Pelicot, who became a global hero to victims of sexual violence during a four-month trial in which her husband and dozens of men were convicted of sexually assaulting her while she was drugged unconscious.

The minister, while speaking to the media on the sidelines of an event to launch department of youth affairs' initiatives against drug addiction, also reiterated the government's position that Pakistani athletes will not be stopped from coming to India for multi-lateral sporting engagements. \"The bill will be tabled in the Parliament during the upcoming session. I will give more details in a couple of days,\" Mandaviya said. The bill seeks to ensure greater accountability for the country's sports administrators with the provision of a regulatory board which would have the power to grant recognition and decide funding to National Sports Federations (NSFs) based on their adherence to provisions related to good governance. The board will also be responsible for ensuring compliance with the highest governance, financial, and ethical standards. In addition, the draft sports bill proposes the establishment of Ethics Commissions and Dispute Resolution Commissions to ensure transparency in governance. It has been debated for a long time and has even been opposed by the Indian Olympic Association, which feels that a regulatory board would undermine its standing as the nodal body for all NSFs. Mandaviya reasserted the government's position that Pakistan's participation in international sports engagements in India won't be stopped despite the turbulent relations that have further deteriorated in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack in April. Next month's men's Asia Cup hockey tournament (Bihar), the FIH Junior World Cup in November-December (Tamil Nadu) and the junior shooting World Cup (New Delhi) in September-October are the major events where Pakistani participation is expected. \"Our stand is clear. We don't have any problems playing with Pakistan in any international sporting event, be it cricket, hockey or any other sport. But when it comes to bilateral engagements, the government position is known to all,\" Mandaviya said. The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has sought clearance from its government for participation in the two tournaments in India, but there is no clarity on whether it has been granted. \"We have told Pakistan that we will grant them visas for the Asia Cup and Junior World Cup hockey tournaments but it is up to their government now to decide whether to send teams or not. We have no problem,\" the sports minister said. \"Both are international tournaments and every team participating will be accorded the same treatment.\" The Asia Cup will be held in Rajgir from August 27 to September 7, while the Junior World Cup is scheduled from November 28 to December 10. The government's decision to allow Pakistan is based on the Olympic Charter which prohibits denial of participation due to political reasons. Such an act can lead to suspension of future hosting rights for that country. India are currently in the race to the host the 2036 Olympic Games and the 2030 Commonwealth Games.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "3:08 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T15:08:00", "topics": ["Narendra Modi", "Sports News", "Mansukh Lal Mandaviya", "Monsoon session of Parliament"], "author": "Press Trust of India", "premium": "False"}

This is the first major dataset published since Donald Trump returned to office, and comes from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) portal. USCIS processed just 2.7 million cases during the quarter, down from 3.3 million during the same period last year. Compared to the previous quarter alone, completions fell by 12 per cent. One of the more striking developments is the return of a “frontlog” — over 34,000 cases were waiting to be opened or assigned, a scenario not seen in more than a year. Key forms are taking longer than ever Form I-129 (used for H-1B and L-1 employment-based visas): Median processing time jumped 25 per cent from the previous quarter, and 80 per cent year-on-year. Form I-90 (green card replacements): Wait time surged from 0.8 months to over 8 months within one quarter, marking a 938 per cent increase. Form I-765 (work permits): Pending initial applications rose 87 per cent. Total pending forms—across renewals and reissues—now exceed 2 million, up from 1.2 million. Net backlog for I-765s (cases outside processing norms): Up by nearly 181 per cent. There was some movement in the other direction for Form I-129s, which saw a 75 per cent drop in net backlog from the previous quarter. However, applications under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme declined by over 8,000. What this means for employers and foreign workers For foreign nationals on temporary work visas and their employers, the delays are already making daily operations uncertain. “In some cases, candidates may not be authorised to enter the US or start work when anticipated. For employees currently maintaining status, adjudication delays may lead to a lapse in work authorisation or an inability to travel internationally,” Blake Miller, partner at Fragomen, a US-based immigration law firm told Business Standard. “Ultimately, delayed processing causes uncertainty for employers around their workforce and for visa holders’ ongoing employment and lawful immigration status.” Charles Kuck, founding partner at Kuck Baxter in Atlanta, put it bluntly: “In simple words, people cannot start their jobs, companies cannot begin projects and growth, and visa holders cannot relocate.” “It’s all intentional,” he told Business Standard. Michael Wildes, managing partner at WILDES & WEINBERG PC, said delays now affect both first-time petitions and extensions. “Backlogs can significantly delay approvals for both initial petitions and extensions, creating uncertainty for employers and foreign workers alike.” Indian green card applicants could face even longer waits For Indian nationals, the situation is compounded by the existing per-country limits for green cards. In FY2023, about 73 per cent of approved H-1Bs (new and continuing) were to Indian-born workers. Approximately 78,070 received lawful permanent residence (a green card). “Indian green card applicants, already facing long wait times due to per-country limits, may see even further delays in adjudication of adjustment of status or consular interviews. These delays can affect work authorisation renewals and create added stress for families waiting to reunite,” Wildes told Business Standard. Miller pointed out that those already in the US on other visas such as the H-1B might not feel the pinch immediately. “In many cases, delays in green card adjudications—whether through adjustment of status or consular processing—do not immediately affect individuals who hold another form of US immigration status or work authorisation.” Kuck noted that consular processing is slowing dramatically, adding, “The data reflects a troubling slowdown in processing that undermines predictability and transparency in the immigration system.” Blame on staff cuts, enforcement shift, and new policies “The Trump administration has told USCIS to slow down processing of cases,” Kuck said. “Predictably, the system has quickly developed massive backlogs. By the end of 2028, we will pine for the days of a functioning legal immigration system because it will effectively not exist by the end of the Trump term.” He attributed the growing backlog to a mix of policy choices: “Starting with the staff reductions ordered at the USCIS (which is funded by user fees, not tax dollars), followed by seeking ‘volunteers’ from USCIS to assist ICE in enforcement efforts, which then leads to the administration’s effort to find fraud in every application, slowing down processing times.” “There is zero per cent chance that processing times will speed up at any time under this administration,” Kuck said. Workarounds and suggestions for Indian applicants Some applicants are choosing to pay extra for premium processing, where available. “Some employers may choose to use premium processing, when available, to help ensure timely adjudication of petitions,” said Miller. However, that may not be enough. “Unless there is a meaningful increase in staffing, technological efficiency, or congressional support, delays are likely to persist,” said Wildes. He added, “The backlog is largely driven by a combination of insufficient staffing, outdated processing systems, and inconsistent policy shifts that strain agency resources. Budgetary constraints and rising application volumes compound the problem.” For those still planning to apply for work, study or family-based immigration, Wildes suggested exploring more than one pathway: “For those with flexibility, exploring multiple pathways—including consular routes or alternate visa categories—can help mitigate risk.” Kuck had a more candid list of dos and don’ts for Indian applicants: • Get a good, experienced lawyer who will tell you the truth • Listen to your lawyer • Be prepared for long delays at USCIS and the consulate • Make sure you are well-prepared for consulate and USCIS interviews • Always bring a lawyer with you to interviews", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "2:54 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T14:54:00", "topics": ["US visa", "immigration", "BS Web Reports"], "author": "Surbhi Gloria Singh", "premium": "False"}

Fuel switch locks have come under scrutiny after a mention of a 2018 advisory from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in a preliminary report into last month's crash of Air India's Boeing 787-8 jet. A spokesperson for the South Korean transport ministry said the checks were in line with a 2018 advisory from the FAA, but did not give a timeline for inspections. Boeing referred Reuters' questions to the FAA, which was not immediately available to comment outside regular hours. In the Air India crash, the switches had almost simultaneously flipped from run position to cutoff just after takeoff, but the preliminary report did not say how they could have flipped to that position during flight. The 2018 FAA advisory recommended, but did not mandate, operators of several Boeing models, including the 787, to inspect the locking feature of the fuel cutoff switches to ensure they could not be moved accidentally. On Sunday, citing a document and sources, Reuters reported that the planemaker and the FAA had privately issued notifications to airlines and regulators that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes were safe and checks were not required. The Air India preliminary report said the airline had not carried out the FAA's suggested inspections as the FAA's 2018 advisory was not a mandate. But it also said maintenance records showed that the throttle control module, which includes the fuel switches, was replaced in 2019 and 2023 on the plane involved in the crash. In an internal memo on Monday, the airline's CEO, Campbell Wilson, said the investigation into the crash was far from over and it was unwise to jump to premature conclusions, following the release of the preliminary report.

Advocate Vrinda Grover, representing Malviya, said the matter was over a cartoon made in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic. \"It may be unpalatable. Let me say it is in poor taste. Let me go to that extent. But is it an offence? My lords have said, it can be offensive but it is not an offence. I am simply on law. I am not trying to justify anything,\" she said.

Additional solicitor general K M Nataraj, appearing for Madhya Pradesh, said such \"things\" were repeatedly done. When Grover said there should be some maturity, Nataraj said, \"It is not the question of maturity alone. It is something more.\" Referring to the time of the cartoon's inception, Grover said there had been no law and order problem since then.

Tag us in your stories/posts Download: https://t.co/jNDDpe1TIX @ICMRDELHI pic.twitter.com/dAbATBF2ra — ICMR - National Institute of Nutrition (@ICMRNIN) July 8, 2025 ‘Sugar and trans fats are the new tobacco’ The move is being compared to the early days of anti-tobacco labelling. \"It’s the beginning of food labelling becoming as serious as cigarette warnings… Sugar and trans fats are the new tobacco. People deserve to know what they’re eating,” said Amar Amale, president of the Cardiological Society of India in Nagpur, told The Times of India. The intent of the signs is not to dictate what people should or should not eat, but rather to inform them about just how unhealthy some everyday foods may be. For instance, a single gulab jamun can contain the sugar equivalent of five teaspoons — the kind of message these boards aim to communicate quickly and clearly. Rising disease burden tied to diet This is especially important with non-communicable diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension on the rise. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), in India, around 77 million people above the age of 18 years are suffering from diabetes (type 2), and nearly 25 million are prediabetics. Moreover, more than 50 per cent of people are not aware of their diabetic status, which can lead to more health complications. Moreover, The Lancet journal estimates that by 2050, about one in three, which would account for nearly 450 million Indians, will be overweight or obese, second only to the United States. One in five urban adults already falls in that category. And rates of childhood obesity are climbing fast, driven by poor diets and sedentary lifestyles. The health ministry’s internal note draws a clear link: India’s growing burden of chronic disease is tied to how and what we eat. Hence, stricter action is needed to increase health awareness among the public, with experts welcoming the directive. Nagpur to lead rollout, rest of India to follow Nagpur will be among the first cities to see the boards. If they work, they could go nationwide and start changing the way India thinks about food. Aiims Nagpur has already started rolling them out. Cafeterias and common areas will soon carry posters with blunt messages like “Eat wisely. Your future self will thank you.”", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "2:37 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T14:37:00", "topics": ["Health Ministry", "trans fats", "Sugar intake", "Sugar", "Health risks", "BS Web Reports", "Snacks", "Health with BS"], "author": "Vasudha Mukherjee", "premium": "False"}

But five days later, things couldn’t be more in contrast. Although both teams did make 387 in the first innings, they took over 100 overs to reach that mark. The wicket became even trickier by the time the second innings came around. Before India were reduced to 58 for 4 by the end of Day 4, England were bundled out for just 192 earlier in the day. Both teams are desperate to win the match and go 2-1 up in the series. And with India needing just 135 runs to win and England needing only six wickets, the final say of the match depends heavily on how the pitch will behave on the final day of play. ENG vs IND 3rd Test: Pitch report for Day 5 In the first three days of the match, the wicket was helping pacers a lot, as Indian and English pacers both took nine wickets each in the first innings. But as seen on Day 4, the wicket is now assisting spinners as well, and Washington Sundar’s spell of 4 for 22 is proof of that. After four days of intense gameplay, the wicket at Lord’s is expected to have cracks around the batting crease, resulting in uneven bounce. India will ask for the heavy roller to settle the wicket, but it is unlikely that it will hold its shape after the drinks interval in the first session. The cracks are expected to come into play by the second hour. And despite India needing a modest total to win, if they leave too many runs for the lower order, England will have every opportunity to sneak a win today. ENG vs IND 3rd Test: Weather report for Day 5 London will experience partly sunny and breezy weather throughout the day, with warm conditions and a high of 26°C.

But how much of it is actually good for you? Here's what experts and evidence say", "content": "For years, social media—particularly TikTok and Instagram—has been obsessed with hitting protein goals. However, recently, a new trend has emerged: Fibre goals and the rise of ‘fibremaxxing’. While these trends are often shared by fitness influencers or wellness creators, it’s important to understand what’s rooted in science and what might be just another passing fad. Why protein goals became popular—and when they’re overdone Protein goals became popular for a good reason: protein helps build and repair muscles, supports metabolism, and promotes satiety (the feeling of fullness). According to Harvard Health Publishing, the average adult needs about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. That’s roughly 50–60 grams daily for someone who weighs around 70 kg. Despite the hype, most people already get enough protein from their regular diet. Overconsumption of protein supplements or shakes may not provide extra benefits for the average person and could stress the kidneys in some cases. Is fibremaxxing actually good for your gut? The new trend of “fibremaxxing” is where users try to meet or exceed daily fibre recommendations. It has gone viral in recent months. Videos showing high-fibre meals, gut health smoothies, and hacks are now gaining traction under hashtags like #fibregoals and #guthealth. Dr Partap Chauhan, founder and director of Jiva Ayurveda, says, “Fibre is having its moment on social media, and rightly so—but the science is not new. Fibre-rich foods like seasonal fruits, whole grains, lentils, and vegetables have always been considered essential for good gut health. The shift from protein obsession to fibre awareness is a welcome one, but the real challenge lies in personalised application. Your body type, digestion, and daily routine must guide your diet, not online trends.” The CDC recommends that adults eat 22 to 34 grams of fibre each day, depending on age and sex. A sudden increase in fibre can lead to digestive discomfort like bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhoea, or cramps. Debalina Dutta, dietician at CMRI Hospital, says that while increasing fibre intake poses little risk for healthy individuals, it may not be suitable for those with conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative Colitis, cholera, or bowel obstruction. What is the Balkan breakfast trend on social media? The Balkan breakfast trend is all over social media, with videos showing plates full of eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, feta cheese, and bread. Creators claim it’s a hearty, healthy, and balanced way to start the day. According to a report by National Geographic, Balkan breakfasts are far more diverse than portrayed. In summer, plates brim with fresh produce; winter meals might feature porridges such as buckwheat or polenta. While nutritionists say this meal is balanced, nutrient-rich, and high in fibre, protein, and healthy fats, they recommend swapping white bread for whole wheat, limiting cured meat, and adding more vegetables. Those watching sodium or fat intake should go easy on the cheese and olives. “Nutrition is very personal, as what is good and might work for one individual may not be ideal for another based on age, medical conditions, activity level, and food preferences. An effective and safe strategy is a balanced, varied, and nutrient-rich diet aimed at overall wellness,” added Dr Srishti Goyal, dietician at Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals. Are super greens powders better than real vegetables? Super greens powders claim to provide concentrated doses of nutrients from spinach, kale, spirulina, and more—all in a scoop. But are they better than eating real vegetables? According to a report by Indian Express, these powders help fill nutritional gaps, especially for picky eaters or people with digestive issues. However, some powders may contain added sugars, preservatives, or interfere with medications. “The best thing to do is listen to qualified professionals and always check if the advice comes from a reliable source. Just focus on real, wholesome food, eat in the right amounts, and enjoy what you eat. That’s the best way to stay healthy in the long run,” said Sowjanya Reddy, Senior Dietitian, CARE Hospitals, Hyderabad. Should you drink water first thing in the morning? Another trending morning ritual is drinking 1–2 glasses of water right after waking up—before tea, coffee, or breakfast. As per Dr Sonia Bhatt from Apollo Hospitals, this habit may help flush out toxins and kickstart digestion, promoting healthy metabolism. She adds, “Lukewarm water is gentler on the stomach, especially if you have acidity or digestive issues. And while drinking water is in general a good habit, drinking more than 4 litres every day continuously might stress out your system.” Can raw carrot salad really balance hormones? This quirky trend recommends eating a raw carrot salad (with vinegar, salt, and coconut oil) once daily to balance hormones—especially oestrogen in women. TikTok users say it improves skin, mood, and PMS symptoms. The trend is credited to Dr Ray Peat, an American biologist and thyroid expert, who claims raw carrot fibre can reduce excess oestrogen, ease migraines, and alleviate PMS symptoms. His observations, based on self-reports and small samples, suggest oestrogen levels dropped within days of adopting the carrot diet. Experts say that the fibre, antioxidants, and other nutrients in carrots do benefit health. It should not be treated as a ‘miracle food’. If you have hormonal imbalances, consult a healthcare provider. “Aim for 4–5 daily servings of colourful fruits and vegetables, which consist of fibre, vitamins, antioxidants, and hydration essential for gastrointestinal health and disease prevention. Choose whole grains like brown rice, oats, quinoa, and millet instead of refined carbohydrates, which contain complex carbohydrates, B vitamins, and fibre that will control blood sugar and keep you satiated. Include high-quality protein food items like legumes, fish, poultry, eggs, tofu, dairy, and nuts to maintain muscle health, immunity, and satiety, while keeping animal-based proteins lean and portion-controlled,” explained Dr Goyal. How do you know if a diet trend is right for you? Dr Chauhan recommends asking three simple questions before following any advice: Does this match my body type? Is it sustainable for me? And is there any discomfort after trying it? Real health trends do not make your life more stressful—they simplify it.

Emkay upgrades Suprajit Engineering to 'Buy' Domestic brokerage Emkay Global Financial has upgraded its rating to 'Buy' from 'Add' on Suprajit Engineering. The brokerage has fixed the target price at ₹550 per share, implying an upside of around 22 per cent. The brokerage notes that despite a sharp turnaround in performance and global positioning, the company remains attractively valued—with the India business alone justifying the current ₹61,000 crore market capitalisation. “Suprajit’s standalone business trades at ~21x FY26E earnings, compared to ~28x for domestic peers. This offers both valuation comfort and downside protection,” the brokerage said in its latest note. “Crucially, its global operations, which contribute 52 per cent of revenues, are being valued at near-zero despite five years of structural groundwork.” ALSO READ: Tech Mahindra Q1 preview: Earnings set to dip QoQ as key segments drag Global scale built, margins now catching up Over the past few years, the company has emerged as the second-largest global player in control cables, behind Japan’s Hilex, through strategic acquisitions such as Wescon, Kongsberg LDC, and SCS. These moves have expanded its global reach and positioned it well for market share gains amid industry consolidation. Notably, profitability in the global business is turning around, with H2FY25 margins crossing the double-digit mark despite macroeconomic headwinds. The SCS acquisition—once a stressed asset—is now witnessing customer traction and improved growth, particularly in Morocco. The company expects SCS to turn Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda)-positive by Q4FY26, with a mid-term margin potential of 6–10 percent. Emkay projects a 9 per cent revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for Suprajet's global division over FY25–28, with margins expanding to 10.9 per cent by FY28 from 5.6 per cent in FY25. Domestic business looks beyond cables In India, Suprajit commands over 80 per cent market share in control cables for two-wheeler original equipment makers (OEMs) and has posted a 10 per cent revenue CAGR and 11 per cent profit after tax (PAT) CAGR over the last five years. But the company is now evolving “beyond cables”, with aggressive research and development (R&D)-led forays into electronics, brakes, instrument clusters, and actuators. Breakthrough order wins from both traditional and electric vehicle (EV) players—including seat activation chipsets for Jaguar Land Rover and electronic grips for a leading Chinese EV OEM—highlight SEL’s growing relevance in next-gen mobility solutions. The domestic business is expected to maintain double-digit growth, with substantial upside from the brakes segment and faster scale-up of Phoenix Lamps Division (PLD). These optional growth levers are not yet priced into the stock, Motilal Oswal notes. Outlook and valuation Overall, Emkay Financial projects revenue, Ebitda, and PAT CAGR of 9 per cent, 21 per cent, and 48 per cent respectively over FY25–28, with return on equity (RoE) improving to 19 per cent and near-zero net debt.

A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said the issue had been pending for long and the uncertainty cannot be allowed to continue. \"We will be fixing the matter in August for final disposal of the main case,\" the bench told senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the Uddhav faction. Sibal said they wanted an expeditious disposal of the case in view of the local body elections in the state. Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for the Shinde faction, said the court had previously refused an urgent hearing on the issue. Sibal said the assembly speaker's decision to hand over the symbol to the opposite party in 2023 based on the legislative majority was contrary to a Constitution bench verdict of the top court. Justice Kant then said, \"We will give the exact date of listing of the matter later as we don't want to clash with other cases.\" On May 7, the top court asked the Thackeray-led faction to concentrate on local body polls after the party sought an urgent hearing on its plea against the Maharashtra assembly speaker's decision. The top court then said the matter would be taken after the summer break. On January 10, 2024 Maharashtra legislative assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar rejected Shiv Sena (UBT) plea to disqualify 16 MLAs of the ruling camp, including Shinde. Challenging the orders passed by the speaker in the apex court, the Thackeray-led faction claimed they were \"patently unlawful and perverse\" and instead of punishing the act of defection, they rewarded defectors by holding they comprised the real political party. The speaker, the plea claimed, erred in holding majority legislators of the Shiv Sena represented the will of the Shiv Sena political party. In his ruling on the disqualification petitions, the speaker did not disqualify any MLA belonging to the rival camps. The speaker's ruling further cemented Shinde's position as the then chief minister, 18 months after he led a rebellion against Thackeray, and added to his political heft in the ruling coalition, which also consists of the BJP and the NCP (Ajit Pawar group), ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and state assembly elections.

The plea was listed on Monday before a bench comprising Justices K Vinod Chandran and NV Anjaria. The legal case started from a lawsuit initiated by Sony Music Entertainment India in 2022 before the Bombay High Court. Sony has sought an injunction to restrain Ilaiyaraaja Music N Management Pvt Ltd (IMMPL) from using 536 musical works. The company claims it acquired rights to these works through Oriental Records and Echo Recording, the entity with which Ilaiyaraaja has long been embroiled in litigation. The IMMPL, however, alleged that 310 of the 536 disputed works are already under judicial scrutiny in a parallel case before the Madras High Court. That case, originally filed by Ilaiyaraaja in 2014 against Echo Recording, challenges the latter's claim over his compositions and seeks recognition of the composer's moral and economic rights under the Copyright Act. The 2014 Madras suit led to a significant 2019 judgment, which upheld Ilaiyaraaja's moral and special rights as a composer.

Both schemes are benchmarked to the BSE Power Index – Total Return Index (TRI), offering exposure to a diversified basket of companies engaged in power generation, transmission, utilities, and infrastructure. First, What Are ETF and ETF FoF? An ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a marketable security that tracks an index, commodity, or sector, and trades like a stock on an exchange. The Groww BSE Power ETF invests directly in the stocks of companies in the BSE Power Index in the same proportion, offering real-time pricing, liquidity, and lower expense ratios. A Fund of Fund (FoF), in this case the Groww BSE Power ETF FoF, is a mutual fund that does not invest directly in stocks, but instead invests in units of the underlying ETF. It is suitable for investors who prefer the ease of SIPs, automatic investment handling, and don’t wish to trade ETFs directly on a stock exchange. Together, they offer two ways to participate in the same theme — ETF for market-savvy investors, and ETF FoF for traditional mutual fund investors. Why Power, Why Now? India's electricity demand has seen a structural surge — from 317 TWh in 2000 to over 1,532 TWh in 2024. But the story is far from over. With per capita consumption still far below global averages, rapid urbanisation, and a shift to EVs and AI-driven data centres, the next phase of power growth is already underway. Key factors driving optimism around the power sector, as per Groww: Massive Headroom for Growth: Per capita consumption in India is just 1.42 MWh, compared to the global average of 3.78 MWh. This is projected to nearly double by 2035. Transition from Deficit to Exporter: India met a record 241 GW peak demand without shortfall in June 2025 and exported $1.5 billion worth of electricity in 2023. Policy Push: ₹31 lakh crore worth of power-related projects are in the National Infrastructure Pipeline. Major government schemes are targeting solar, battery storage, and grid modernization. Clean Energy Shift: Solar and wind capacities now stand at 100 GW and 50 GW respectively. Renewables have become increasingly cost-competitive compared to coal. Rising Demand from Tech: With 123 million EVs expected by 2032 and rapid expansion of data centres, electricity consumption will see new drivers beyond traditional usage. Strong Sector Fundamentals: Between 2020 and 2024, BSE Power Index constituents doubled their revenues and tripled net profits — reflecting structural sectoral strength. Why the BSE Power Index? The BSE Power Index is composed of 14 companies across the power value chain: Power Generation – 39% Transmission – 18% Integrated Utilities – 13% Infrastructure and Equipment – 30% Top constituents by weight include: It has also historically outperformed the BSE Sensex over medium and long-term periods, underlining its investment potential. Product Highlights Minimum Investment: ₹500 Exit Load: Nil Benchmark: BSE Power Index – TRI Fund Managers: Nikhil Satam, Aakash Chauhan, and Shashi Kumar Tracking Approach: SPEARTech-based high-frequency rebalancing for reduced tracking error Groww’s new offerings provide a convenient and cost-effective gateway for investors seeking to ride the megatrends reshaping India’s energy economy — especially those who prefer index investing with a long-term horizon.

This surge, according to Emkay Global Financial, has pushed the valuations out of the ‘attractive’ territory and has left little room for further re-rating. Most indices (Nifty50/BSE200/Small-and-midcap) are trading in a range between their long-term average (LTA) and above plus one standard deviation (+1sd), with the BSE200 and Midcap indices trading at the highest premium. Drilling deeper, Emkay notes that 34 per cent of its tracked universe—comprising over 500 companies covered by at least five analysts—are currently trading at +1sd above their long-term mean. This is up from 11 per cent in March 2025, though still below the September 2024 peak of 44 per cent. In this context, analysts at Emkay Global Financial has taken a 'cautious' stance on Indian equities in the near term and anticipates a period of consolidation over the next one to two quarters. However, any sharp correction, according to the brokerage, may offer a favourable entry opportunity. ALSO READ: NFO Alert! Groww MF launches BSE Power ETF; here's all you need to know Market outlook Stable earnings outlook, but Q1 to remain muted While the overall earnings trajectory appears stable, Q1FY26 is expected to be soft, with most of the weakness already priced in. The Nifty FY26 earnings per share (EPS) saw only a marginal downgrade of 84 basis points (bps) over the past month. Key consensus downgrades were seen in Tata Motors, Bajaj Finance and Shriram Finance, while upgrades were scarce. In the BSE200 category, the EPS was cut by 68 bps between May and June with Adani Green/Tata Motors/REC seeing the sharpest consensus cuts. Overall, Emkay Financial believes, the share of companies seeing upward revisions of over 10 per cent in FY26 EPS has dropped to 23 per cent—down from 27 per cent in the previous quarter. Analysts expect growth sentiment to recover in H2FY26, with potential for earnings upgrades later in the year. Global flows to support, but promoter selling warrants caution In June 2025, the fund flows have been robust with strong inflows from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mutual funds (MFs), as markets rallied from early April. Systematic investment plan (SIP) flows have been heavy into large, Small-and-midcap, and flexicap funds, shifting from thematics/focused funds. While domestic flows have a strong tailwind from falling rates as yields on fixed-income investments fall further, global flows are also expected to be strong with continued pressure and a soft landing in the US and Western economies. While primary market activity deepens breadth and keeps valuations from overheating, elevated promoter offloading will be closely tracked in the coming weeks. Primary market activity has picked up– initial public offers (IPOs) have raised ₹19,900 crore (0.06 per cent of equity market cap) with a strong pipeline.

After the counsel appearing for the producers sought urgent listing of the plea saying that the film's release was stayed despite the censor board certification, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said it would hear it on Wednesday or any day thereafter. The counsel contended that the apex court had refused urgent listing of the plea seeking a stay on the film's release but the high court interfered and stayed it on July 10. \"We have spent money on the movie and obtained CBFC certification, but despite that the high court stayed its release. This is a violation of our rights,\" the counsel contended and sought urgent listing of the plea on Tuesday. The bench said it would hear the plea on Wednesday or any day thereafter. On July 10, the Delhi High Court stayed the release of 'Udaipur Files' till the Centre decides on pleas seeking a permanent ban on the film over its potential to \"promote disharmony\" in society. The high court had directed the petitioners to approach the Centre within two days with their grievance, while noting that they have not taken the recourse to approach the Central government. The petitions, including one filed by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind president and Darul Uloom Deoband principal Maulana Arshad Madani before the high court, had claimed that a trailer of the movie released on June 26 was replete with dialogues and instances that had led to communal disharmony in 2022, and carries every potential to stoke the same sentiments again. The film's producer contended before the high court that \"this is a typical India-Pakistan plot. The petitioner has taken dialogues out of context.\" The high court on July 9 directed the producers to arrange a screening of the film for the petitioners. Udaipur-based tailor Kanhaiya Lal was murdered on June 2022 allegedly by Mohammad Riyaz and Mohammad Ghous. The assailants had later released a video claiming that the murder was in reaction to the tailor allegedly sharing a social media post in support of former BJP leader Nupur Sharma following her controversial comments on Prophet Mohammed. The case was probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the accused were booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, besides provisions under the Indian Penal Code. The trial is pending before the special NIA court in Jaipur. On July 9, the top court had refused to urgently list a plea challenging the release of 'Udaipur Files', and orally observed, \"Let the film be released\". The petition before the top court was filed by Mohammed Javed, who is facing trial as the eighth accused in the case.

The drop was largely driven by deflationary trends in food articles, fuel and power, and basic metals, according to the data released by the Commerce and Industry ministry on Monday. WPI-based inflation has been steadily easing since March and hit a 14-month low of 0.39 per cent the previous month. The WPI measures the average change in prices of goods sold in bulk and serves as a key indicator of inflation at the producer level.

WPI Food Index The WPI food index declined to -0.26 per cent year-on-year, compared to 1.72 per cent seen in May. This came despite a month-on-month increase in the Food Index to 190.2 from 189.5, supported by higher prices of vegetables, fruits, and milk. However, on an annual basis, vegetable prices were down, with the onion prices falling 33.49 per cent, and potatoes declining by 32.67 per cent. Fuel and power Fuel and power inflation declined to -2.65 per cent in June, compared to -2.27 per cent in May.

Manufacturing sector Manufactured products, the largest component of the WPI basket, stood at 1.97 per cent. Prices rose in segments such as pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, and electronics, while basic metals, food products, and tobacco products recorded declines. Among manufactured items, vegetable and animal oils and fats continued to witness deflation, with prices falling 23.05 per cent year-on-year.

Ahead of the potential launch, the alleged design and specifications of the Galaxy S25 FE have surfaced on the web. Another piece of information has surfaced online recently, which suggests that the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE might sport an LTPO display and feature an upgrade in battery capacity. Here’s what to expect from the anticipated smartphone. Galaxy S25 FE: What to expect According to GSMArena, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S25 FE is largely expected to retain last year’s design, but with a shift to Armor Aluminium, and become slimmer and lighter at 7.4mm thick and 190g (down from 8.0mm and 213g). It will likely feature a 6.7-inch FHD+ LTPO display with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz and Gorilla Glass Victus+ protection, distinguishing it from the S25+’s higher-resolution panel and Victus 2 protection. The Galaxy S25 FE might be powered by the Exynos 2400 chip, paired with 8GB RAM and storage options of 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, as reported by GSMArena. Battery capacity might be bumped to 4,900mAh (from 4,700mAh), with 45W fast charging — up from 25W — while 15W wireless charging is expected. The camera setup is expected to remain mostly unchanged with a 50MP main, 8MP 3x telephoto, and 12MP ultra-wide. However, the selfie camera will reportedly get an upgrade to 12MP, possibly with autofocus. The device is also expected to follow Samsung’s seven-year software support promise.

It was Washington's four-wicket haul that enabled India to bowl out England for 192 on day four. In response, India stumbled to 58 for four with Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Karun Nair and night watchman Akash Deep returning to the hut. We want so many things the way we expect it to be, but yes, we'll take it any day. We'll really come out positive tomorrow. We've got some solid batsmen in the dressing room. It's exciting in every way, you know, winning a Test in Lord's is going to be amazing. So, I think we're sitting pretty, said Washington in the post-day press interaction. Chosen ahead of Kuldeep Yadav for his all-round abilities, Washington vindicated his selection with timely strikes to dent the opposition. Definitely, one of the best days with the ball for me, especially outside of India. But yes, definitely had some solid plans coming into this Test match and really wanted to execute them both in first and second innings. There are different roles thrown at me in different passages of play. I would say that's where Test cricket gets a lot more exciting because you've got to be a slightly different cricketer at least with your mindset on day five compared to on day one, said Washington who enjoyed getting through the stumps of in-form Jamie Smith. Is he visualising a win on Monday? A win as a team at Lord's would be very, very special for us. It would be amazing. I am sure for you guys as well. It's going to be exciting tomorrow. I mean, especially the last 15-20 minutes was quite interesting today, he said referring to the increased intensity of players towards close of play. I would say the aggression is always inside of us in both dressing rooms. It's just that there was an incident that happened and it sort of came out as well last evening (Day 3). And it did come out quite a bit today as well. It definitely does (fuel energy) I mean, it's a sport and everyone is quite aggressive and quite intense in their own ways. I mean, no matter the sport, if you're an athlete, it's a common factor, I'd say. We wanted 250-plus England batting coach Marcus Trescothick said the team was aiming to set a target in excess of 250. We always wanted 250-plus. In the first innings, it was hard to judge what a decent score would be. We have something to push on for tomorrow. Bashir is fit to bowl. He can come on when he is needed, said the former opener referring to the off-spinner's finger injury on his non-bowling hand. England were egged on by a sellout crowd in the last 30 minutes of play and that helped the players on field, said the batting coach. If I knew who would win tomorrow I would relax a little bit. Both teams are desperate to win. Amazing four days of cricket. The last half hour was amazing. The crowd was behind the team and we love that sort of situation. Buzz around the ground gave the boys hope that they needed. A lot will revolve around the first hour of play tomorrow, reckoned Trescothick. The India batters will need to be wary of the wobbled seam deliveries going by what has transpired on the first four days. What we have seen is variation in bounce for quick bowlers. Wobble seam ball, the talk of the town are dangerous deliveries here. Hopefully it will seam everywhere and we get six wickets in the first session, Trecothick said on a lighter note.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "12:33 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T12:33:00", "topics": ["India cricket team", "England cricket team", "ICC World Test Championship", "Test Cricket"], "author": "Press Trust of India", "premium": "False"}

Green was 42 not out at stumps and with captain Pat Cummins (5) managed to arrest the slide of the Australian second innings in difficult night conditions at Sabina Park. The pace bowlers dominated all three sessions Sunday with 15 wickets fell across both teams. Australia's all-pace attack had earlier given the visitors the upper hand when it dismissed the West Indies for 143 in the late afternoon to take an 82-run first-innings lead. When the lights were turned on, Australia faced a tough contest with the swinging pink ball and especially initimidating bowling from Alzarri Joseph (3-19) and Shamar Joseph (2-26) as it tried to build its advantage. Australia lost Sam Konstas to a five-ball duck in the second over from Shamar Joseph which set in motion the decline of its second innings. The 19-year-old Konstas has had a disappointing series, tallying 50 runs in six innings. Usman Khawaja (14) and Steve Smith (5) both were bowled in conditions which again encouraged the pace bowlers. Alzarri Joseph took two wickets in the 21st over as Australia slumped to 69-6. Beau Webster hit a boundary from the first ball he faced, promising to match fire with fire, but was out for 13, bowled by Alzarri Joseph. Alex Carey was stuck on the helmet on the next delivery and was out to the same bowler two balls later. We wanted seven wickets. We got six wickets, Shamar Joseph said. So I'm actually pleased with that performance. The West Indies have a great legacy of fast bowlers. Our young generation just want to continue it and do our best. I actually think anything (target) under 200, to 200 we definitely could chase that. Scott Boland took 3-34 and Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins snared two wickes apiece as the West Indies were dismissed in just over 52 overs in their first innings. The last West Indies wicket fell just before the dinner break, by which time 20 wickets had fallen in five sessions. John Campbell and Shai Campbell provided some resistance as the West Indies made painstaking progress against the Australia pacers after resuming Sunday at 16-1. The West Indies took honors on the first day, bowling out Australia for 225, then negotiating the final 40 minutes before stumps in the face of aggressive bowling in difficult conditions under the floodlights. The Australian bowlers maintained good line and length in the first session on Day 2, making scoring difficult and bringing the stumps and lbw into play. The West Indies added only 57 runs in 23 overs before the first interval for the loss of Brandon King (14) and Roston Chase (18). The West Indies lost seven wickets for 70 runs in the second session as Australia asserted control. Campbell produced an eventful and patient 36 in 97 minutes. He was lucky not to be run out at 15 when he jabbed a ball to mid-on and set off for a quick single. Cummins' under-arm throw hit the stumps on the full and it seemed Campbell's bat might have bounced at the same time. But the umpires chose to review, ruling the Australians had not appealed. Cummins challenged the decision without success. Campbell eventually was out lbw to Boland, not offering a shot to a ball which seamed back more than he expected. Hope also had a second chance when he was dropped by wicketkeeper Alex Carey off Boland when he was 21. The reprieve was shot-lived and he was bowled by Boland two balls later without adding to his score. Carey earlier dropped Justin Greaves off Mitchell Starc but neither error was costly. When Hope was out the rest of the West Indies wickets tumbled quickly, the last five falling for 19 runs. Australia's bowlers have dominated the series after winning the first two tests by 159 runs in Barbados then by 133 runs in Grenada to secure the Frank Worrell Trophy.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "12:29 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T12:29:00", "topics": ["Australia cricket team", "West Indies cricket team", "Test Cricket"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

According to a report from 9to5Mac, citing Bloomberg, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will introduce key new features focused on health tracking and off-grid communication. These include high blood pressure detection, satellite-based messaging, and support for 5G Redcap connectivity. Other than a Black Titanium version, there have not been any major changes to the Apple Watch Ultra since 2023. However, the upcoming model could deliver a significant change. Here are the advanced features expected to debut with the next generation model: Apple Watch Ultra 3: New features High Blood pressure detection According to the report, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will feature high blood pressure detection capabilities. This feature will not provide exact blood pressure readings but will notify users if they show signs of hypertension. The device is not expected to display specific diastolic or systolic numbers but will alert users when irregular blood pressure patterns are observed. The feature works similar to how the watch currently detects conditions like sleep apnea, providing early warnings rather than detailed medical data. Satellite Messaging The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will support satellite messaging, which is designed for outdoor enthusiasts and adventurers. This will allow users to send text messages via satellite when cellular or Wi-Fi connections are not in range, enabling \"off-the-grid\" communication. The device will likely use Globalstar’s satellite network, the same provider that Apple has used for satellite connectivity on iPhones since the launch of iPhone 14 series. The Watch Ultra 3 marks the first time Apple brings satellite support directly to the Watch. 5G Redcap connectivity Another addition coming to Apple's Ultra Watch 3 is the 5G Redcap support. The 5G Redcap is a more energy-efficient version of 5G, which is ideal for wearables. This 5G version offers better speed without significantly impacting battery life. This standard is designed to bridge the gap between full-fledged 5G and LTE. It will replace the existing 4G LTE connectivity, which has been the limit for previous Ultra models. What more? In addition to these three features, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is also expected to include a faster chip and an upgraded OLED display, likely aligning with the anticipated Apple Watch Series 10 models.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "12:29 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T12:29:00", "topics": ["Apple", "Watch", "smartwatches", "Apple Watch"], "author": "Sweta Kumari", "premium": "False"}

CATCH STOCK MARKET LIVE UPDATES TODAY Sectoral play The majority of the sell-off in the last trading session was driven by IT stocks, following Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reporting lower-than-expected Q1FY26 earnings. IT stocks, which hold a 14.8 per cent weight in the Sensex, second only to banks, saw broad-based declines. Adding to the pressure, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are switching gears, putting a stop to the buying spree. According to National Securities Depository (NSDL) data, equity flows via stock exchanges for July (up to the 11th) show net outflows of ₹555 crore, marking the first negative monthly figure in over three months, after consistent positive inflows in April, May and June. \"Nifty has been exhibiting weak trend weighed mainly by the weakness in the IT stocks. This weakness may persist particularly since the FIIs were big sellers in the cash market last Friday. It is important to note that banking and financials are outperforming even in this weak market. This trend may persist,\" said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Investments. What should traders do? As D-street continues to trade in a range-bound trajectory due to a lack of cues, market analysts suggest that investors take a cautious approach while booking profits during rallies. The Nifty50 is currently trading below the psychological 25,500 level; however, the market tone continues to be cautiously bullish, as per analysts \"In the current environment of heightened volatility and mixed market signals, traders are advised to follow a cautious 'sell on rise' strategy, especially when trading with leverage. Booking partial profits on rallies and using tight trailing stop-losses is recommended to manage risk effectively,\" said Hardik Matalia, derivative analyst- research at Choice Equity Broking. \"Fresh long positions should only be considered if the Nifty sustains above the 25,378 level. While the broader market undertone remains cautiously bullish, it is essential to keep a close watch on key technical levels and global market cues,\" he said. Meanwhile, the earnings season is likely to provide some directional cues in the coming weeks.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "12:27 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T12:27:00", "topics": ["MARKETS TODAY", "Markets Sensex Nifty", "IT stocks", "sensex ends down", "TCS stock", "India Inc earnings", "HCL tech stock", "Markets"], "author": "Harshita Dudeja", "premium": "False"}

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported at least 37 people killed, including two children, in the clashes between armed groups from the Druze religious minority and Sunni Bedouin clans around the province. The UK-based war monitor reported that military convoys were sent to the area to reinforce security checkpoints. The observatory said the clashes had started after a series of kidnappings between both groups, which began when members of a Bedouin tribe in the area set up a checkpoint where they attacked and robbed a young Druze man. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the observatory, said the conflict started with the kidnapping and robbery of a Druze vegetable seller, leading to tit-for-tat attacks and kidnappings. Syria's defence and interior ministries were deploying personnel to the area to attempt to restore order. The interior ministry in a statement called the situation a dangerous escalation that comes in the absence of the relevant official institutions, which has led to an exacerbation of the state of chaos, the deterioration of the security situation, and the inability of the local community to contain the situation despite repeated calls for calm. Factions from the Druze minority have been suspicious of the new authorities in Damascus after former President Bashar Assad fell in a lightning rebel offensive led by Sunni Islamist insurgent groups in December. Earlier this year, Druze groups in Sweida clashed with security forces from the new government. The Druze religious sect is a minority group that began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. In Syria, they largely live in the southern Sweida province and some suburbs of Damascus, mainly in Jaramana and Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to the south. The Druze developed their own militias during the country's nearly 14-year civil war. Since Assad's fall, different Druze factions have been at odds over whether to integrate with the new government and armed forces.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "12:26 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T12:26:00", "topics": ["militants", "Syria", "Shia-Sunni divide"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

Palmer received the Golden Ball as top player of the tournament after scoring the first two goals in Chelsea's 3-0 smothering of Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday night. Trump appeared to leave the award stand with a medal of his own, handed to him by FIFA President Gianni Infantino right after the medallion presented to James. At 23, Palmer was selected player of the match for Chelsea's second straight final. A rising English star, he assisted twice in a 4-1 win over Real Betis on May 28 that won the Europa Conference League. He also scored the Blues' first goal in the 2-1 quarterfinal Club World Cup win over Palmeiras and had England's goal in its 2024 European Championship final defeat to Spain. He had his name up in the bright lights this weekend. He posed for a photo in front of a huge video board of his image in a Nike ad emblazoned with the words: Scary Good. It was part of a campaign that also features Kylian Mbapp, Erling Haaland and Vincius Jnior. I've seen the billboards in Times Square and outside of Madison Square Garden, Palmer said. It's a nice feeling to be obviously alongside them type of players. Palmer had almost identical left-footed goals from just inside the penalty area in the 22nd and 30th minutes, then sent a through pass that enabled Joo Pedro to chip goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the 43rd for his third goal in two starts with the Blues. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, who wanted to exploit space on PSG's left flank, told his players he wanted them to attack from the opening whistle. I think we won the game in the first 10 minutes and the message before the game was let them understand that we are here to win the game,\" Maresca said. Probably set a little bit the tone of the game. Chelsea went ahead after Snchez kicked the ball downfield and Nuno Mendes mis-hit his header 15 yards past the midfield stripe toward his own goal. Malo Gusto's shot was blocked by Lucas Beraldo and rebounded to Palmer, who ended PSG's streak of 436 minutes without conceding. These are the games where we expect Cole to appear because they are big games, big moments, Maresca said. Palmer doubled the lead in the 30th when he ran onto a long ball from Levi Colwill and cut inside before shooting for his 18th goal of the season. It's a great feeling. Even better because obviously everyone doubted us before the game, Palmer said. \"The gaffer put a great gameplan out, and obviously, he knew where the space was going to be.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "12:26 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T12:26:00", "topics": ["Donald Trump", "football", "Chelsea"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

England had bounced back from losing to France in its opener by routing the Netherlands 4-0 and it raced into a 4-0 halftime lead against Wales following goals from Georgia Stanway, Ella Toone, Lauren Hemp and Alessia Russo. Substitutes Beth Mead and Aggie Beever-Jones added more in the second half either side of Hannah Cain's stylish consolation for Wales. We're just happy that we continued the standards that we'd set against the Netherlands, Stanway said. It was super important that we continue where we'd left off and we could build momentum post that. The result saw Sarina Wiegman's team advance as runner-up in Group D, ensuring England a potentially easier path to the final, after France beat the Netherlands 5-2 to win the group. Wales and the Netherlands are eliminated. England will play Sweden in the quarterfinals and could then face either Norway or Italy. Had they won the group, the Lionesses would have encountered Germany before a possible semifinal against World Cup winner and tournament favorite Spain, which plays host nation Switzerland in the last eight. England beat Sweden 4-0 in the Euro 2022 semifinals, although the two subsequent matches between the two nations have ended in draws. It's a completely different tournament, it's really hard to compare anything that happens in other tournaments, Stanway said. Our focus is on us, our focus is making sure that we know our things going into the game. Today we focus on the result that we've just had and how proud we are to get out of the group. There's been many days this tournament where we could have actually been going home, so to be in this situation, to be staying a few more days is something that we can be proud of. It was always going to be a tall order for Wales, on its tournament debut, to beat the reigning champion. It had lost nine of its 10 previous matches against England, only managing one draw against its neighbor and historic rival. Penalty opener And the challenge for Wales became even harder when England was awarded a penalty by the video assistant referee after Carrie Jones tripped Stanway just inside the area. Stanway sent the penalty into the bottom left corner to give England a 13th-minute lead and a disaster in defense allowed the Lionesses to double that tally eight minutes later. An attempted clearance came off Stanway and fell to Russo, who rounded the Wales goalkeeper before rolling it across for Toone. The Manchester United forward's first attempt was blocked by Wales defender Lily Woodham but she lashed the rebound into the top right corner. Toone turned provider in the 30th, running onto a pass from Lauren James and crossing for Hemp to head in from a tight angle at the back post. It was Hemp's first goal since returning from a five-month layoff after undergoing knee surgery in November. Wales had been poor, while England had been brutally efficient and the Lionesses added another goal on the stroke of halftime. A sublime pass from James between two Welsh players released Toone, who rolled it across for Russo to tuck into the bottom left corner. Halftime changes With the result a foregone conclusion, Wiegman rang the changes at halftime, bringing on Jess Park and Mead for Toone and Hemp. Mead was the Euro 2022 player of the tournament and she got her first goal in this edition in the 72nd minute after a superb bit of skill saw her latch onto a good ball from Beever-Jones and carve out some space in the area before slotting past Clark. Cain briefly reduced the deficit before Beever-Jones headed in Mead's cross in the 89th minute to wrap up the scoring.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "12:23 PM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T12:23:00", "topics": ["football"], "author": "AP", "premium": "False"}

Anand Rathi - Management commentary The first quarter saw a sharp rebound in equity markets, with the Nifty advancing 8.5 per cent and the Nifty 500 rising 10.7 per cent, propelled by renewed domestic buying and moderating foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows. India’s GDP is expected to grow by 6.6 per cent in FY26, driven by strong domestic demand, government-led capital expenditure, and a robust financial sector. This growth is likely to further increase the number of high net worth individuals (HNIs), and ultra high net worth individuals (UHNIs), creating significant opportunities for the wealth management industry. ALSO READ | Why did this Aditya Birla group company's stock decline 5% in trade today? Anand Rathi - Outlook Emerging markets, particularly in Asia, present a mixed equity market outlook. China's equity markets may face headwinds due to trade policy uncertainties and structural economic adjustments. Conversely, India's markets are expected to benefit from strong domestic demand and public investment, aligning with the country's strong expected GDP growth, Anand Rathi Wealth said in its FY25 annual report. India's equity markets are poised for a positive trajectory, underpinned by robust economic fundamentals, favourable valuations and renewed investor confidence. Considering India's strong economic growth, favourable market valuations and increasing investor inflows, the equity market outlook appears positive. While projections vary, an annualised return exceeding 12 per cent for the Nifty 50 index over the next couple of years appears increasingly plausible, the company said. Meanwhile, despite its strong growth trajectory, the Indian wealth management industry faces several structural challenges. Nevertheless, the medium to long-term outlook remains highly favourable. With India's household financial wealth projected to grow at over 10 - 12 per cent annually, driven by rising incomes and deeper financialisation, the demand for professional wealth management services is expected to rise significantly, Anand Rathi Wealth said in its annual report.

As many as 23 deaths occurred here due to heart attacks over the course of 40 days. Of these, six were between 19 and 25 years of age. Meanwhile, eight were between 25 and 45 years of age. Long queues outside hospitals and health centres reflected the panic among people, with many rushing for cardiac checkups amid fears of sudden heart failure. But while panic spreads, medical experts urge calm and say it’s time to focus on prevention. Why are young adults collapsing without warning? According to Dr Anand Agarwal, HOD of CTVS (Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgery), Sri Madhusudan Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Chikkaballapur, Karnataka, it’s not the elderly who are crowding the emergency rooms—it’s people in their 30s. “These young adults are seemingly healthy and have no symptoms until they collapse. Unlike older people, younger patients lack adequate collateral blood supply to the heart, making these attacks far more fatal,” he explained. This means that you may look and feel fine, but your heart could be struggling. Dr Agarwal noted that while older people typically have time to react and seek help during a cardiac episode, younger individuals often experience sudden and massive cardiac arrests, sometimes without the classic warning signs. What’s causing this spike? Is it just Mysuru’s problem? “This is a pan-India pattern we’ve seen building for years,” said Dr Agarwal. “It’s now getting noticed because of the concentration of cases in one region.” He listed the key culprits: Chronic stress and anxiety Hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes Sedentary lifestyle (especially sitting for long hours) Poor eating habits and erratic work schedules Long commutes Lack of sleep Skipped workouts Possibly post-Covid complications, although evidence is still emerging Is your lifestyle silently harming your heart? “Erratic work hours, eating junk food, minimal physical activity, smoking, and alcohol—all these add up quickly in your 30s,” said Dr Agarwal. If your daily routine includes screen fatigue, skipped breakfasts, and midnight swiping through Instagram, you’re not doing your heart any favours, he warned. What are the early signs of a heart attack you shouldn’t ignore? According to Dr Agarwal, if you feel any of these, even once, don’t brush it off as gas or stress: Chest pain during activity or even at rest Shortness of breath Extreme fatigue for no reason Pain radiating to your left arm or neck Nausea, dizziness, or cold sweats “These are classic early warning signs, and ignoring them often delays life-saving care,” Dr Agarwal emphasised. What should you do now to protect your heart? Here’s a quick checklist from Dr Agarwal that could save your life: Eat mindfully: Avoid bingeing, skipping meals, or constant snacking on ultra-processed food Sleep well: Poor sleep messes with blood pressure and hormones—don’t compromise Quit smoking and reduce alcohol: Yes, even “just a few drinks on weekends” adds up Move your body: Walking, yoga, stretching—even 20 minutes a day helps Manage stress: Meditation, deep breathing, or just logging off for a while can help your heart relax Listen to your body: If something feels off, get it checked Dr Agarwal stressed that heart attacks don’t just happen to “old uncles.” They’re happening to young, driven professionals, just like you. “You can take charge now and protect your heart before it’s too late. Pushing through stress is not a badge of honour. At least your heart doesn’t agree,” he concluded.

This comes as part of a broader immigration crackdown by the United States government. “US visa screening does not stop after a visa is issued,” the embassy posted on X. “We continuously monitor visa holders to ensure they follow all US laws and immigration rules – and we will revoke their visas and deport them if they don’t.” The embassy’s message serves as a caution for those travelling to the US on both immigrant and non-immigrant visas, including tourists, students and workers. Anyone found violating immigration rules, overstaying visas or misrepresenting information could face consequences even after arriving in the US. Social media now part of background checks The embassy has also reminded applicants that they are now required to list their social media history on the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used in the last five years on the DS-160 visa application form,” the embassy wrote. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas.” The policy, introduced earlier but reiterated recently on the embassy’s channels, reflects a tougher stance on background checks. While passwords are not requested, all handles used on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit and LinkedIn must be disclosed. Applicants certify that the information provided is true before submitting the application. Misrepresentation or omission of accounts—even unused or forgotten ones—may be treated as dishonesty and affect future visa eligibility. What counts as a social media identifier? According to US government guidelines, a social media identifier is any name used by an individual on social platforms. This includes usernames or handles, even if the account is no longer active. The visa form lists specific platforms for which handles are required. If a person has used multiple accounts on the same platform, each must be listed separately. Who must provide this information? The rule applies to nearly all immigrant and non-immigrant visa applicants, with a few exceptions. Applicants for diplomatic and official categories such as A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3 (except personal staff), G-1 through G-4, and NATO visas are not required to provide social media details. However, tourist visa applicants under the B-2 category, as well as students, workers and family-based visa applicants, must include this information. Here’s what this means for B-2 tourist visa applicants: • All usernames or handles used in the last five years must be listed • This applies even if the applicant no longer uses the platform • Each account on every listed platform must be mentioned individually • No passwords are required—only the identifiers • Failure to list a handle may be treated as misrepresentation What if someone has no social media? Applicants without any social media presence can answer “None.” The form allows for this response and the absence of an account will not count against the applicant. However, the embassy cautions that all responses must be honest and complete. Inaccurate or incomplete information can delay processing or lead to refusal. What is the US government doing with the data? The information provided is used to assess whether an applicant qualifies for a US visa under current immigration law. Consular officers do not request passwords or access to private messages. The US government, in its FAQ, said the policy strengthens its ability to verify identities and vet applicants more thoroughly before granting entry.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "11:18 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T11:18:00", "topics": ["US visa", "immigration", "BS Web Reports"], "author": "Surbhi Gloria Singh", "premium": "False"}

In the past two trading days, the stock price of the pharmaceutical company has surged 13 per cent. In comparison, the BSE Sensex was down 0.25 per cent at 82,291 at 10:31 AM. However, thus far in the calendar year 2025, Neuland has underperformed the market by falling 6 per cent, as against 4.8 per cent rise in the benchmark index.

Crisil Ratings reaffirms credit rating assigned to Neuland On June 20, 2025, Crisil Ratings reaffirmed its ‘Crisil A+/Stable/Crisil A1’ ratings on the bank loan facilities of Neuland Laboratories. The rating agency in its rationale said that the ratings continue to reflect the established market position of Neuland in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) segment, its established clientele, healthy business performance, product and geographical diversification, and comfortable financial risk profile. These strengths are partially offset by susceptibility to fluctuations in raw material prices, intense competition and regulatory risks, moderate working capital requirement and vulnerability of operating margin to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, Crisil Ratings said. The custom manufacturing services (CMS) segment is set to recover in fiscal 2026 with one molecule already commercialised and one more expected to be commercialised during the fiscal. The segmental revenue will improve with more projects expected under development. With the incremental contribution from the CMS segment and healthy continuing demand from the API segment, the operating margin is expected to recover over the medium term, Crisil Ratings said. ALSO READ | Gland Pharma shares rise on GMP nod for Telangana manufacturing unit Neuland Labs - Outlook According to the management, the revenue contribution from the CMS segment will be 55 per cent - 60 per cent over the next three-to-four years. The management highlighted that since FY25 is a year of consolidation, the company’s performance moderated while maintaining flattish revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. However, management is confident upon the revenue growth trajectory in FY26 on account of the completion of additional manufacturing facilities, coupled with the scaling up of commercial molecules in the CMS segment. “We entered FY 2025-26 with renewed momentum, underscored by the completion of additional manufacturing facilities, the anticipated commercial launch of new CMS molecules, and increasing customer interest across both generic drug substances (GDS) and CMS portfolios. These developments, along with our continued focus on operational excellence and long-term capability building, strengthen our confidence in delivering sustainable growth,” Neuland said in its FY25 annual report. The diversification away from China by Western pharmaceutical companies as they look to rebalance their supply chains is also creating fresh opportunities. Neuland said, the company is well positioned to benefit from this trend, supported by a strong reputation, high-quality infrastructure, and regulatory credibility. While tariff related developments are being closely monitored, the management does not foresee a material impact, as the company’s primary competitors are based outside the US, and its position as a preferred supplier to many customers helps mitigate potential disruptions.

The order was issued on Sunday through a public notice under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. It applies to all individuals, institutions, and organisations across Delhi. The DPCC has made it clear that anyone found violating the ban will face legal consequences, India Today reported. To ensure the ban is properly enforced, the public has been encouraged to report violations. Complaints can be made through: The Noise Pollution Grievance Redressal web portal The Green Delhi mobile app The helpline number 155271 Emergency services via 112 The decision comes as part of ongoing efforts to improve Delhi’s air quality, especially during winter months when pollution typically peaks. This is not the first time a firecracker ban has been enforced on the national capital. A similar restriction was introduced last year by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. Crackdown on online firecracker sales In line with the firecracker ban, the Delhi Police have issued instructions to e-commerce and social media platforms to stop the online listing and delivery of firecrackers within the city, news agency ANI reported. This directive follows the Supreme Court’s order dated May 6, 2025 and aims to ensure complete compliance with the NCT (National Capital Territory) government’s orders. According to a statement from the Delhi Police Crime Branch, ecommerce platforms have been told to remove firecracker listings in Delhi; apply location-based restrictions to prevent sales in the city; inform customers clearly about the prohibition and; instruct delivery partners not to accept or transport firecrackers. They have also been asked to confirm compliance in writing. Any failure to follow the order will attract criminal prosecution under relevant laws. Banquet halls, hotels also advised Not just online sellers — banquet halls, hotels, and guesthouses have also been informed to strictly comply with the ban. Police have issued advisories urging them to ensure no manufacturing, storage, or bursting of firecrackers takes place on their premises. ₹35 cr worth of Chinese firecrackers seizes In a significant crackdown under ‘Operation Fire Trail’, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) last week seized Chinese firecrackers and fireworks worth ₹35 crore that had been illegally imported, according to a report by news agency PTI.

Trump has ratcheted up trade measures, promising that more tariffs are coming to everyone from Canada to Brazil to Algeria and inviting trading partners to negotiate further. Despite warnings of complacency from the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, investors have so far behaved as if they’re counting on the US president to back down, having seen previous U-turns from his administration. “Investors shouldn’t bank on Trump only bluffing with the 30 per cent tariff threat on EU goods,” Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, wrote in an email. “That level of tariffs is punitive, but it likely hurts them more than the US, so the clock is ticking.” Currency markets suggested risk appetite is beginning to wane, with the dollar and Japanese yen edging higher against most Group-of-10 peers in early trading while the Australian dollar and euro led losses. The euro touched its strongest level against the dollar since 2021 this month as investors assessed the region’s relative growth prospects. Meanwhile, the Mexican peso set a one-year high of 18.5525 versus the dollar on July 9. Bitcoin, which trades through the weekend, climbed to as high as $119,489 in early trading Monday, a fresh record high. President Trump and his allies’ criticism of Jerome Powell’s handling of the expensive renovation of the Fed’s headquarters — with some administration officials building a case to remove Powell from the Fed’s Board of Governors — may also weigh on markets at the start of the week. Deutsche Bank AG strategist George Saravelos said the potential dismissal of Powell is a major and underpriced risk that could trigger a selloff in the US dollar and Treasuries. “If Trump were to force Powell out, the subsequent 24 hours would probably see a drop of at least 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the trade-weighted dollar, as well as a 30 to 40 basis point fixed-income selloff,” Saravelos said. The greenback and bonds would carry a “persistent” risk premium, he said in a note, adding that investors may also grow anxious about the potential politicization of the Fed’s swap lines with other central banks. Tariff Campaign Financial markets have been struggling with how to price in the on-again, off-again tariff campaign instigated by Trump so far in his second term. While markets responded to the April 2 “Liberation Day” announcements by selling risk assets and even US Treasuries, those moves have now almost all reversed as the president delayed many of his threatened levies. The EU had been trying to conclude a tentative deal with the US to stave off higher tariffs, but Trump’s letter punctured the recent optimism in Brussels. The US president did, however, leave an opening for additional adjustments. “As usual, there are many conditions and clauses that can get these rates reduced,” Jacobsen wrote. “That’s probably why the market might not like the tariff talk, but it’s not panicking about it either.” Even when Trump said that Aug. 1 would be a hard deadline, markets reacted as if that date was still negotiable. They did show some signs of caution Friday, when stocks fell from all-time highs as Trump intensified his trade offensive, and the dollar rallied for its best week since February. “The market isn’t believing Trump, so we may see pressure on the exchange rate, but only temporarily,” said Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis at Grupo Financiero Base. “Unless the tariff actually goes into effect and is collected, because according to US trade data, the IEEPA tariffs aren’t being collected to the letter.”", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "9:58 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T09:58:00", "topics": ["Trump tariffs", "US tariff", "Market forecast"], "author": "Bloomberg", "premium": "False"}

The number of novel drugs in China — for cancer, weight-loss and more — entering into development ballooned to over 1,250 last year, far surpassing the European Union and nearly catching up to the US’s count of about 1,440, an exclusive Bloomberg News analysis showed. And the drug candidates from the land once notorious for cheap knock-offs and quality issues are increasingly clearing high bars to win recognition from both drug regulators and Western pharmaceutical giants. The findings, gleaned from an analysis of a database maintained by pharma intelligence solutions provider Norstella, show a fundamental shift in medical innovation’s center of gravity. With President Donald Trump already threatening tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector, China's biotech advances — the scale of which is slowly coming into view — risk becoming another realm of superpower rivalry like artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. “The scale itself is not something we’ve seen before,” said Helen Chen, managing partner at LEK Consulting in Shanghai, who has advised healthcare companies on their China strategy since 2003. “The products are here, they’re attractive and they’re fast.” This shift has occurred at an unprecedented pace. When China began to overhaul its drug regulatory system in 2015, the country had just 160 compounds to contribute to the global pipeline of innovative drugs, or less than 6% of the total, behind Japan and the UK. The reforms helped streamline reviews, enforced data quality standards and improved transparency. The government’s ‘Made in China 2025’ plan to elevate manufacturing in 10 priority sectors also helped spur a flurry of investments in biotechnology. Altogether, they unleashed a boom led by foreign-educated and -trained scientists and entrepreneurs. “Not only is it now almost at parity with the US but it has that growth trajectory,” said Daniel Chancellor, vice president of thought leadership at Norstella. “It wouldn’t be sensationalist to suggest that China will overtake the US in the next few years purely in terms of numbers of drugs that it’s bringing through into its pipeline.” Bloomberg News' data analysis focuses on innovative drugs, excluding generic combinations, reformulations and biosimilars. Numbers aside, the more stunning leap is in the quality of Chinese biotech innovation. While there's constant debate in the pharmaceutical industry on whether Chinese firms are capable of producing not just effective but needle-shifting new therapies, there's growing recognition on multiple fronts. The world’s strictest regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, increasingly view Chinese drugs as generally promising enough to justify devoting extra resources to speed up their review, handing them coveted industry designations such as priority review, breakthrough therapy designation or fast track status. The country is now slightly ahead of the EU in earning such expedited reviews as of 2024, the data shows, a remarkable edge over a region that previously produced drugs like Wegovy. One of the early exemplars of Chinese innovation is a cell therapy that has shown promise to potentially cure a deadly blood cancer. First developed in China by Legend Biotech Corp, it is now marketed by Johnson & Johnson — having won a few expedited review designations along the way — and considered superior to a competing US-originated therapy. Still, the absolute number of China-originated drugs winning these designations trail their US counterparts by a large margin. Risk-aversion remains a factor holding back Chinese pharmaceutical innovation: So far, top companies tend to focus on making better versions of existing therapies or new iterations of older ideas, and few are pioneering novel treatment approaches that have never been tried before — an endeavor that comes with a high risk of failure and is still led by the US, Europe and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Nevertheless, the biggest Chinese breakthroughs are increasingly being snapped up by pharmaceutical giants for record sums, a sign that the perennial competition for the next blockbuster drug is also shifting East. A novel cancer drug from Akeso Inc., which came out more effective than Merck & Co Inc.’s Keytruda in a Chinese study last year, has been likened to China biotech’s DeepSeek moment, spawning a new wave of global interest. The promise of topping Keytruda, the world’s top-selling drug, also swelled the valuation of Summit Therapeutics Inc, which in 2022 paid $500 million upfront for the development and marketing rights in the US and other regions. Other multinational players like Merck, AstraZeneca Plc and Roche Holding AG have also scooped up Chinese assets. In May, Pfizer Inc. set a new record as it announced a $1.2 billion upfront deal with 3SBio Inc. for a cancer drug similar to Akeso’s. These deals are increasing in both value and frequency, according to biopharma deal database DealForma, signaling confidence that China-originated drugs are competitive internationally and can bring in substantial revenue. The volume of potential candidates coming out of China means multinational companies, who have a constant need to add new products to the mix, can “cast their net wider than ever before,” Norstella’s Chancellor said. A key advantage that has fueled the rise of Chinese biotech firms is their ability to conduct research cheaper and faster at every step of the way, from lab experiments and animal testing to human trials. Creating a new drug from scratch is notoriously time-consuming and expensive, and China's massive patient pool and centralized hospital network have become a significant accelerator. An analysis of the time taken for drugs to conduct various testing stages shows that doctors in China can recruit for trials much faster — for early trials for cancer and obesity drugs, they can complete patient enrollment in half the time compared to the US. The difference in costs means Chinese companies can afford to run multiple trials simultaneously to find a winner, or quickly launch new projects once a scientific idea is validated by other groups. Since 2021, China has become the top location for clinical research, initiating the largest number of new trials globally, according to GlobalData. “They can leapfrog competitors in other countries,” said Andy Liu, head of China at Novotech Health Holdings, which helps companies run clinical trials. To be sure, clinical data in China is just a start. US regulators have made it clear that China-only trial results, no matter how positive, are not sufficient to support drug approvals. Chinese biotechs with ambition to sell their drugs overseas must prove that their treatment benefits can be replicated in non-Chinese patients, through complex and slower-moving global studies. It may still be a few years before a critical mass of drugs sourced from China wins US and EU approvals — the gold standard for high-quality treatments — and become widely used in the Western world, but many in the industry believe that's inevitable. China’s innovators comprise both cutting-edge biotech startups founded by foreign-educated entrepreneurs, and old-guard Chinese pharmaceutical companies like Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals Co., which used to be one of the country’s biggest generic drugmakers. The company poured billions of dollars into shifting to innovative research and development after Beijing’s campaign to lower generic drug prices made that sector less profitable. It's now the world's top-ranked pharmaceutical company for the number of new innovative drugs added to the research pipeline in the period of 2020-2024. Of the 50 companies that generated the highest number of innovative drug candidates between 2020 and 2024, 20 of them were Chinese, compared to five in the five years before. “As we move forward, the fact that there’s high quality innovation in China in terms of biotech will no longer be a novelty,” said Ali Pashazadeh, founder and managing director of healthcare advisory firm Treehill Partners in London. “It’ll just be an accepted part of the norm.” At a time when China and the US are engaged in renewed geopolitical spats, the growth of China’s biotech ecosystem is causing alarm among some American politicians and business leaders. A congressional commission warned that the US risks losing its leadership position in yet another industry critical to national security. “Biotech is one of the forefronts of the US-China tech rivalry,” said Jack Burnham, research analyst at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. In addition to economic implications and possible military applications of biotech, China’s leverage on innovative therapies may be weaponized in a future conflict, he said, if Americans become dependent on those medicines. The perception of threat has spurred calls for the US government to stymie China’s biotech growth — through restrictions such as export controls on scientific equipment and barriers to investment — and boost the domestic biotech sector, including by changing the regulatory environment to emulate countries where clinical trials are run more quickly. Robert F. Kennedy, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services, recently pledged to “Make American Biotech Accelerate.” Despite the risks of the newly combative relationship between the world's two biggest economies, Chinese drugmakers like Akeso have set their sights on bringing their therapies to developed Western markets. “The pharma industry is the best industry in the world,” Akeso Chief Executive Officer Michelle Xia said in an April interview. “At the end of the day, what we do benefits patients in China, in the US and all around the world.”", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "9:53 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T09:53:00", "topics": ["China", "biotech", "Biotechnology", "drug manufacturers", "Pharmaceutical companies"], "author": "Bloomberg", "premium": "False"}

The ill-fated Boeing 787 Dreamliner, bound for London, crashed shortly after takeoff, killing 260 people — 241 onboard and 19 on the ground. The incident, India’s deadliest aviation accident in over a decade, has prompted the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to issue special directives to fast-track claim settlements. Claims Range from Baggage Loss to Accidental Death ICICI Lombard General Insurance reported receiving claims under travel and personal accident policies. These include accidental death, trip cancellations, baggage loss, and hotel booking cancellations. “We are working on a priority basis to provide seamless assistance and ensure timely settlements. Our commitment is to support our policyholders and their families during this difficult time,” said Priya Deshmukh, Head – Health Products, Operations & Services, ICICI Lombard. Bajaj Allianz also confirmed receiving three personal accident claims and one marine cargo insurance claim, indicating that goods in transit may have been affected. Personal accident covers are emerging as a significant category, second only to life insurance claims. Quick Settlements, Group Policies Activated New India Assurance has already settled seven individual personal accident claims and five under group policies. A notable case involved a group personal accident policy for 4,000 residents of Mehsana district, where the claim was processed and settled within a week of the crash. One Kisan Credit Card-related claim worth ₹50,000 was also honored. Axis Max Life Insurance, under its ‘InstaClaim’ process, settled one claim within three hours of receipt. “This reflects our focus on empathetic action when it matters most,” said Manu Lavanya, COO, Max Life. However, most insurers have refrained from disclosing the exact number or details of claims, citing the ongoing process of receiving formal requests from the families of the deceased. In one notable case, a group personal accident policy covering 4,000 people in Mehsana district resulted in a claim settlement within a week of the crash, a representative of the insurer said. IRDAI Steps In to Ease Process Recognizing the scale of the tragedy, the IRDAI issued a circular on June 14 instructing insurers to fast-track payouts. The regulator has waived formal requirements like FIRs and postmortem reports and directed companies to submit weekly updates starting June 16. Insurers were also asked to appoint nodal officers to assist affected families. What’s Next for Claimants? Insurance company representatives said that many bereaved families are still coping with their loss and may approach insurers in the coming weeks. Given the exceptional circumstances, companies have promised to show flexibility and prioritize compassionate engagement. The Ahmedabad crash underscores the importance of having comprehensive insurance coverage — especially for frequent flyers, business travelers, and families with exposure to international travel — and highlights how insurance, when structured correctly, can serve as a financial lifeline in the worst of times.

For months, US officials have been effusive about Mexican cooperation on issues related to the border and security. “Very responsive,” raved Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “Positive momentum,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called it. On Saturday, Trump blasted the country’s response in a letter threatening 30 per cent tariffs. “What Mexico has done is not enough,” he wrote. “Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels.” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called for the country to keep “a cool head,” but a sense of exasperation swept over people involved in the US negotiations, according to people familiar with the talks. Their cordial approach suddenly seemed to have yielded little — for now. The neighboring nation is looking to persuade Trump that Mexico and the US are complementary economies, and that Mexico is willing to cooperate against cartels in unprecedented ways, added the people, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Trump’s threat of a 30 per cent rate, with exceptions for products certified under the trilateral trade agreement between the two countries and Canada, is unlikely to drastically move the needle beyond the 25 per cent rate already in place, according to Bloomberg Economics. Nearly 83 per cent of US imports from Mexico were exempt from tariffs in May, mainly due to exemptions on USMCA-compliant goods. But Trump’s 30 per cent threat isn’t much better than the 35 per cent rate he announced for Canada, which has taken a much more confrontational tone with Trump while Mexico played nice. Some US officials tried to suggest cooperation could continue despite the letter. US Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said Saturday in Mexico City that Sheinbaum and Trump have a “wonderful relationship” and no partnership should be easier than between their two countries. “America First doesn’t mean America alone. In fact, I’m here in Mexico with my arms open in friendship with a message of true respect for the sovereignty of Mexico,” he said at a tuxedo-filled gala thrown in his honor and attended by many from Mexico’s political, business and media elite. Sector-specific tariffs, including on steel and soon on copper, had given Mexico in recent weeks reasons to appeal to Trump’s officials for a fairer deal as it seeks to protect its position as the US’s top trade partner in the world. It had shielded part of its export industry by negotiating to have a previously announced auto duty limited to the non-US portion of cars. “Mexican authorities will likely continue to engage constructively with the US administration, on border control and to some extent also by hardening the stance against the drug cartels and the flow of fentanyl into the US, in order to preserve access to the US market under competitive conditions,” wrote Alberto Ramos, head of Latin American economics at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., in a note. Mexico’s peace offerings have included the extradition of dozens of high-profile detainees involved in the drug trade, and an increase in busts along drug routes. Its security minister has been one of the visitors in the Washington talks, and on the domestic front the government has pushed for legislation to increase investigations of unsolved crimes. But ties have also been strained in recent weeks by the US announcement of a move to cut off three Mexican financial firms over potential involvement in money laundering for drug cartels. For now, Mexico is staying the course. The Economy Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that Minister Marcelo Ebrard had been in Washington since Friday for negotiations with the White House, the US Trade Representative and the Commerce Department, and that Mexico would defend its interests. The ministry called Trump’s proposed tariff increase, to take effect Aug. 1, “unfair.” Mexico will work to find “an alternative that allows us to protect businesses and jobs on both sides of the border,” the ministry said.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "9:25 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T09:25:00", "topics": ["Donald Trump", "US mexico", "Trump tariffs"], "author": "Bloomberg", "premium": "False"}

According to Iran's state-run Fars news agency, Pezeshkian had sustained minor leg injuries in an Israeli air strike during a meeting of the Supreme National Security Council in Tehran on June 15. He was forced to flee through an emergency exit following the attack. Al Jazeera quoted an Israeli official saying that the \"assassination attempt\" was aimed at the heads of the three branches of government in an effort to overthrow it. The strike was carried out shortly before noon during a meeting attended by the heads of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the government. Israel has not publicly commented on the report. Iran's council building targeted by Israeli missiles According to Al Jazeera, the Israeli strike targeted a high-level meeting of Iran's Supreme National Security Council in western Tehran, where Pezeshkian and the heads of three branches of the government, along with other senior officials, were in attendance. The building's entrances and exits were hit by six missiles in an attempt to block escape routes and cut off air flow. Electricity was severed following the explosions, but Iranian officials managed to escape through a pre-designated emergency hatch, including the president, who is said to have sustained minor leg injuries while evacuating, reported Al Jazeera. Iranian authorities have reportedly launched a probe into the suspected presence of Israeli spies, given the striking accuracy of the intelligence used in the attack. Pezeshkian confirms Israeli role in strike In an interview to American commentator Tucker Carlson last week , Pezeshkian claimed that Israel had attempted to assassinate him. “They did try, yes, but they failed,” he said. “It was not the United States behind the attempt on my life. It was Israel. I was in a meeting when they tried to bombard the area where we were holding that meeting.” Heavy toll on both sides amid escalating conflict At least 1,060 people were killed in Iran during the conflict, according to Iran’s Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs.

What’s driving this luxury housing surge? Here are the key factors at play: Rising disposable income: Aided by accommodative monetary policy and rising incomes in the salaried and entrepreneurial class. Desire for larger, well-located homes: Post-pandemic lifestyle upgrades are here to stay—homebuyers now prioritise space, amenities, and prime locations. Developer confidence and quality: Developers are focusing more on transparency, experience, and high-end finishes—boosting buyer trust. Stable interest rates: RBI’s pause on rate hikes has made home loans relatively more attractive, even in the luxury segment. “The standout growth of luxury and premium housing indicates rising consumer confidence and lifestyle aspirations,” said Gaurav Kumar, MD - Capital Markets and Land at CBRE India. Where are the big jumps happening? Delhi-NCR: 3,960 units sold in Jan–June 2025 vs 1,280 a year ago Mumbai: 1,240 units sold vs 950 Bengaluru: 200 units sold vs 80 Chennai & Kolkata: Both saw more than 2.5x growth Hyderabad & Pune: Bucked the trend with slight drops \"The housing boom, coupled with policy evolution, highlights the need for reforms that ease approvals, redefine affordable housing in urban India, and incentivise sustainable development,\" Manish Singhal, Secretary General, ASSOCHAM, said. Total sales in the top seven cities rose to 6,950 units in January-June 2025 from 3,750 units in the corresponding period of the preceding year. Commenting on the data, Jash Panchamia, Executive Director at Jaypee Infratech Ltd, said, \"The sharp surge in demand for premium residential properties during the first half stands as a clear testament to the fact that the appetite of homebuyers continues to remain robust and resilient across the leading real estate micro-markets in the country.\" The various reform measures announced in the Union Budget and the RBI's accommodative monetary policy stance have played a pivotal role in enhancing the overall disposable income levels of the average household, he added. What should buyers keep in mind? Timing Matters: With sales surging, prices may follow. Entering early could be financially prudent if you're planning a purchase in the next 6–12 months. Due Diligence is Key: Check for RERA compliance, developer reputation, and resale value. Long-Term Asset: Luxury homes are not just lifestyle assets but potential long-term investments in land-constrained urban micro-markets. Financing Benefits: High-end home loans often come with preferential rates and tax advantages.

Since the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi’s) ban on US trading firm Jane Street on July 3 derivatives trading turnover has declined by a fifth. BSE Ltd shares fell nearly 16 per cent from July 3 levels following the ban on US-based proprietary trader Jane Street for alleged index options manipulation. The stock closed at ₹2,376 on Friday, down 3.7 per cent over its previous day's close, reducing its market capitalisation to ₹96,650 crore. Meanwhile, unlisted NSE shares dropped 13 per cent this week to ₹2,100 apiece, according to platforms that deal in unlisted shares. This has reduced NSE’s market value to ₹5.43 trillion. Its shares had previously rallied to ₹2,400 amid optimism over its initial public offering (IPO) as the bourse neared a settlement with regulators in a protracted legal case involving lapses at its colocation facility. “The sharp fall in NSE and BSE shares this week is a mix of short-term noise and shifting market dynamics. The change in the derivatives' expiry dates has unsettled traders a bit. At the same time, Sebi’s recent action against Jane Street has added to the caution. There is a concern that tighter rules have also raised fears that F&O turnover could shrink further,” said Trivesh D, chief operating officer at Tradejini. On the first expiry of Nifty weekly contracts since the ban on US-based high frequency trading firm, the total turnover on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) dropped 21 per cent compared to the previous expiry day. Index options turnover on a notional basis slipped to ₹472.5 trillion on Thursday, down from ₹601 trillion on July 3 — ahead of the ban on Jane Street. “The key unknown is whether this instance can lead to a knock-on impact on trading volumes, and we feel that trends over the next week on derivatives volumes will be key to watch, especially the index derivatives expiries on Tuesday and Thursday,” noted Jefferies. The research firm added that proprietary traders and HFTs may see a manageable impact from the exit of Jane Street as manipulative factors potentially reduce. “Hedge funds largely operate with larger positions in Single Stock Futures and their trading in options is limited,” added Jefferies, noting that the exit by Jane Street may have a limited impact on the earnings of BSE.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "9:16 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T09:16:00", "topics": ["Stock Market", "NSE", "BSE", "Markets", "The Smart Investor"], "author": "Khushboo Tiwari", "premium": "False"}

As a result, a rating-wise risk scale, similar to the mutual funds’ risk-o-meter, can be considered to help investors make informed decisions. Additionally, the exchanges advised the bond investors to be mindful of taking into account the bond’s credit rating, the issuer’s track record in timely repayments, the liquidity of the instrument, settlement timelines, and the tax implications of the investment. “…it is crucial to verify that the platform is a Sebi-registered Online Bond Platform Provider (OBPP),” the statement said. The exchanges also explained the yield to maturity (YTM), the total annualised return an investor can expect if the bond is held until its maturity, is not a guaranteed return as it fluctuates based on factors such as changes in market interest rates, liquidity conditions, time to maturity, and the creditworthiness of the issuer. Also, if the bond is sold before maturity, the actual return may differ significantly from the indicated YTM. Generally, when a bond’s price is below its face value, its YTM is higher than its coupon rate, and vice versa. Similarly, the exchanges have cautioned the investors that the coupon rate-- fixed annual interest paid by the issuer -- is not risk-free and is dependent on the financial health and credit reliability of the issuer.

It’s since merged with the social media service X in a deal Musk said valued the AI startup at $80 billion and the social network company at $33 billion. The potential investments emerged as the combined entity XAI Holdings engages in talks to raise money at a valuation of as much as $200 billion, Bloomberg News has reported. They suggest Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer is seeking to more closely entwine the various parts of his corporate empire. This month, the CEO revealed Tesla will adopt Grok within vehicles — days after the bot posted antisemitic content on X. The integration suggests an expanded relationship between the two firms, something some Tesla investors have called for as EV sales have slumped. Tesla disclosed in April that xAI was a customer last year, with the startup incurring $198.3 million of expenses tied to commercial, consulting and support agreements with the carmaker. The bulk of that business — $191 million — involved xAI purchasing Tesla’s utility-scale energy storage batteries, called Megapack.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "9:09 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T09:09:00", "topics": ["Elon Musk", "Artificial intelligence", "Elon Musk Tesla", "Tesla"], "author": "Bloomberg", "premium": "False"}

Mounting margin pressures amid heightened competition, deflation in staples, and rising operating costs have left brokerages on a wait and watch mode, with many trimming estimates and target prices despite strong revenue growth and store additions. Revenue for the quarter (Q1FY26) rose 16.3 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to ₹16,359.7 crore, but missed the Bloomberg estimate of ₹16,583 crore. Ebitda grew 6 per cent Y-o-Y to ₹1,299 crore, trailing the expected ₹1,354 crore. The Ebitda margin slipped to 7.9 per cent, down from 8.7 per cent a year ago and below the 8.2 per cent consensus. Net profit was flat at ₹773 crore, also missing the street’s estimate of ₹883 crore. The company attributed the revenue growth impact of 100–150 basis points (bps) to deflation in key categories and noted that gross margins remained under pressure due to continued competitive intensity within FMCG. Higher operating costs, driven by store expansion and inflation in entry-level wages, also weighed on profitability. DMart added nine new stores in the quarter, bringing the total to 424 as of June 30. Brokerages flagged the narrowing margin trajectory and shift in sales mix as near-term concerns. Nuvama maintained a ‘Hold’ rating and revised its target price to ₹4,086 from ₹4,273, citing sustained margin pressure. It highlighted that while the company delivered 7.1 per cent like-for-like (LFL) growth, deflation in food and non-food staples led to a gross margin squeeze of 27 basis points and Ebitda margin contraction of 66 bps. Thus, Nuvama cut its FY26/27 profit estimates by about 6 per cent/8 per cent. ICICI Securities reiterated its ‘Reduce’ rating with a target price of ₹3,800, citing muted profitability and sluggish LFL sales growth, which slowed to 7.1 per cent from 9.1 per cent a year ago. The brokerage noted that revenue per sq. ft. remained 5-6 per cent below pre-Covid peaks and flagged weak conversion from revenue to profit due to elevated costs. It continues to model 19 per cent PAT CAGR over FY25-27E but remains cautious pending strategic clarity under the new CEO. Meanwhile, Motilal Oswal reiterated its ‘Buy’ call but reduced the target price to ₹4,500 from ₹4,800, noting pressure on margins and cost of retailing, despite strong store additions. It expects margin headwinds to persist in the near term due to competitive pricing and investments, but remains optimistic about DMart’s long-term store economics and scalability. JPMorgan also retained a ‘Hold’ rating with a target price of ₹4,150, acknowledging solid LFL growth and ongoing expansion but warning of continued margin compression due to higher investments, according to reports. It sees the upcoming annual management interaction as a key catalyst. Others were more bearish. Morgan Stanley reportedly maintained an ‘Underweight’ with a target price of ₹3,350, flagging continued earnings disappointment and intensifying competition as drivers of valuation de-rating. HSBC echoed this cautious tone with a ‘Reduce’ rating and a target price of ₹3,600, noting this was the fifth straight quarter of Y-o-Y margin decline, according to reports. While store expansion remains aggressive, the brokerage does not view it as sufficient to offset profitability concerns. Overall, analysts are largely aligned in their view that while Avenue Supermarts continues to deliver steady top-line growth through store additions, the structural pressures on margins – especially from competition, wage inflation, and an unfavourable sales mix – remain key risks. The market is now awaiting signals of a strategic shift, particularly on improving margins and digital execution under the new leadership.", "date": "Jul 14 2025", "time": "9:03 AM", "datetime": "2025-07-14T09:03:00", "topics": ["Buzzing stocks", "The Smart Investor", "Stock Analysis", "BSE Sensex", "Nifty50", "DMart", "Avenue Supermarts", "Q1 results", "Markets Sensex Nifty", "MARKETS TODAY", "stock market trading", "Indian equities", "JPMorgan", "Morgan Stanley", "HSBC", "ICICI Securities", "Motilal Oswal"], "author": "Tanmay Tiwary", "premium": "False"}
